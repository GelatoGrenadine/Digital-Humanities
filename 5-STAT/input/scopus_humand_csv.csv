We partnered with Adrian Wisnicki’s digital humanities project One More Voice to create an online anthology and video series that critically frame folklore collections from Japan, India, South Africa, and Jamaica. The students learned about Sara Ahmed’s politics of citation and applied her ideas in giving credit to the Indigenous coauthors who sourced, transcribed, and translated oral folktales for British colonizers.

A practical workflow for the 3D reconstruction of complex historic sites and their decorative interiors: Florence As It Was and the church of Orsanmichele,0,10.1186/s40494-022-00750-1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135140533&doi=10.1186%2fs40494-022-00750-1&partnerID=40&md5=899f1da57f37c23d2c9b6719952e2d47,"The Digital Humanities project Florence As It Was (http://florenceasitwas.wlu.edu) seeks to reconstruct the architectural and decorative appearance of late Medieval and early Modern buildings by combining 3D point cloud models of buildings (i.e. extant structures such as chapels, churches, etc.) with 3D rendered models of artworks that were installed inside them during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This paper documents a novel bifurcated workflow that allows the construction of such integrated 3D models as well as an example case study of a church in Florence, Italy called Orsanmichele (https://3d.wlu.edu/v21/pages/orsanmichele2.html). The key steps worked out in the optimized workflow include: (1) art historical research to identify the original artworks in each building, (2) the use of LiDAR scanners to obtain 3D data (along with associated color information) of the interiors and exteriors of buildings, (3) the use of high resolution photogrammetry of works of art (i.e. paintings and sculptures) which have been removed from those buildings and are now in public collections, (4) the generation of point clouds from the 3D data of the buildings and works of art, (5) the editing and cojoining of a textured polygon model of artworks with a reduced size (using novel algorithms) point cloud model of the buildings in an open-source software tool called Potree so that artworks can be embedded in their original architectural settings, and (6) the annotation of these models with scholarly art historical texts that present viewers immediate access to information, archival evidence, and historical descriptions of these spaces. The integrated point cloud and textured models of buildings and artworks, respectively, plus annotations are then published with Potree. This process has resulted in the development of highly accurate virtual reconstructions of key monuments from the Florentine Middle Ages and Renaissance (like the fourteenth century building of Orsanmichele and the multiple paintings that were once inside it) as they originally appeared. The goal of this project is to create virtual models for scholars and students to explore research questions while providing key information that may assist in generating new projects. Such models represent a significant tool to allow improved teaching of art and architectural history. Furthermore, since the assigned location of some of the historic artworks within these sites are not always firmly known, the virtual model allows users to experiment with potential arrangements of objects in and on the buildings they may have originally decorated. © 2022, The Author(s).",Digital humanities,Florence,LiDAR,Model,Orsanmichele,Photogrammetry,Potree,Scan,Bent G.R.,Pfaff D.,Brooks M.,Radpour R.,Delaney J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports the main aspects of the implementation of a virtual reality tool integrated with an online repository for storing 3D models, metadata and chemical analyses related to different sectors of digital humanities. The virtual reality software, developed for the Oculus Quest 2 hardware, is called PROTEUS and allows for seamless transition from the macroscopic world of digital humanities to the microscopic world of molecular sciences. The paper illustrates, by means of some case studies, the performances of this innovative tool that permits the researcher to understand and manipulate objects, to test hypotheses and to seek meaningful results, visualising the metadata while changing the parameters of the simulation in a dynamic and interactive way. This represents also a significant step forward in the democratisation of science, thanks to an user-friendly and immersive access to advanced scientific algorithms, which allow the natural perception of structural and topological features of the underlying molecular and supra-molecular systems.

On the one hand, recognizing meaningful patterns based on domain knowledge and visual perception is extremely hard. On the other hand, applying traditional clustering and feature reduction techniques to the highly dimensional pixel space can be ineffective. To address these issues, in this paper we propose DELIUS: a DEep learning approach to cLustering vIsUal artS. The method uses a pre-trained convolutional network to extract features and then feeds these features into a deep embedded clustering model, where the task of mapping the input data to a latent space is jointly optimized with the task of finding a set of cluster centroids in this latent space. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. DELIUS can be useful for several tasks related to art analysis, in particular visual link retrieval and historical knowledge discovery in painting datasets. © 2022, The Author(s).",Autoencoders,Computer vision,Cultural heritage,Deep clustering,Digital humanities,Visual arts,,,Castellano G.,Vessio G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a case study to assess the viability of this approach, we look at the problem of handwritten document transcription. While good progress has been made towards automatically transcribing modern handwriting, significant challenges remain in transcribing historical documents. Here we describe a general enhancement strategy, underpinned by the new loss formulation, which can be applied to the training regime of any deep learning-based document transcription system. Through experimentation, reliable performance improvement is demonstrated for the standard IAM and RIMES datasets for three different network architectures. Further, we go on to show feasibility for our approach on a new dataset of digitized Latin manuscripts, originally produced by scribes in the Cloister of St. Gall in the the 9th century. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",deep learning,digital humanities,Document transcription,visual psychophysics,visual recognition,,,,Grieggs S.,Shen B.,Rauch G.,Li P.,Ma J.,Chiang D.,Price B.,Scheirer W.J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we work closely with the constructors of a new dataset, CGED-Q (China Government Employee Database-Qing), that records the career trajectories of over 340,000 government officials in the Qing bureaucracy in China from 1760 to 1912. We use these data to study career mobility from a historical perspective and understand social mobility and inequality. However, existing statistical approaches are inadequate for analyzing career mobility in this historical dataset with its fine-grained attributes and long time span, since they are mostly hypothesis-driven and require substantial effort. We propose CareerLens, an interactive visual analytics system for assisting experts in exploring, understanding, and reasoning from historical career data. With CareerLens, experts examine mobility patterns in three levels-of-detail, namely, the macro-level providing a summary of overall mobility, the meso-level extracting latent group mobility patterns, and the micro-level revealing social relationships of individuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of CareerLens through two case studies and receive encouraging feedback from follow-up interviews with domain experts. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",career mobility,Digital humanities,quantitative history,visual analytics,,,,,Wang Y.,Liang H.,Shu X.,Wang J.,Xu K.,Deng Z.,Campbell C.,Chen B.,Wu Y.,Qu H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The proposed STEF uses methods of information extraction, sentiment analysis and geographic information system to achieve knowledge extraction and mining. STEF integrates time, space and emotional elements to visualize the spatial and temporal evolution of emotions, which thus enriches the analytical paradigm in digital humanities. Findings: The case study shows that STEF can effectively extract knowledge from unstructured texts in the field of Chinese Qing Dynasty novels. First, STEF introduces the knowledge extraction tools – MARKUS and DocuSky – to profile character entities and perform plots extraction. Second, STEF extracts the characters' emotional evolutionary trajectory from the temporal and spatial perspective. Finally, the study draws a spatio-temporal emotional path figure of the leading characters and integrates the corresponding plots to analyze the causes of emotion fluctuations. Originality/value: The STEF is constructed based on the “spatio-temporal narrative theory” and “emotional narrative theory”. It is the first framework to integrate elements of time, space and emotion to analyze the emotional evolution trajectories of characters in novels. The execuability and operability of the framework is also verified with a case novel to suggest a new path for quantitative analysis of other novels. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities,Knowledge extraction,Knowledge mining,Natural language processing,Spatio-temporal emotional analysis,,,,Deng J.,Zhong C.,Sun S.,Wang R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ecosystem is conceived as a distributed software platform establishing data ecosystem and open standards for the management of information, aimed at providing different services and applications to address the needs of the various end-users identified. The platform has been conceived and realised in the framework of a Horizon 2020 research project, with a view to building a set of holistic knowledge about rural regions and their cultural and natural heritage and making it available for long-lasting heritage-led territorial processes of change. It is the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration amongst heritage, digital humanities and ICTs experts, and combines data and methodologies from a range of approaches to humanities together with the customisation of effective digital tools. It has been designed for deployment also in cloud systems compliant with the Infrastructure-as-a-Service paradigm. All data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR data). It hosts and integrates different tools, making the data gathered with/for local stakeholders usable and making the same data re-usable within the tools’ functions, generating integrated heritage knowledge. It comprises data on 19 rural pilot territories, where the tools and their integration have been developed and tested, while 62 more are partially included as additional territories which participate in certain activities within the project. The main testers for this platform and its functions are the local stakeholders of these territories. The paper describes and analyses the platform and its impact, discussing the integration of tools as an innovative approach that goes beyond the use of individual tools in shaping a multidimensional vision. It also offers an analysis of the potential of an integrated digital ecosystem in evidence-based and place-based regeneration strategies.

This study focuses on the less explored topic of imbalanced volunteer engagement (IVE); it refers to the fact that most volunteers tend to focus only on a small portion of tasks, making it challenging to sustain cultural heritage crowdsourcing (CHC) projects. Using a public dataset containing 145,168,535 items captured from the Australian Newspaper Digitisation Project, we utilized a machine learning-based causal inference approach to investigate the IVE problem by examining the causal relationships between task content characteristics and volunteer engagements. We used the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent the structure, such that a causal relationship consisting of 11 nodes and 16 edges was obtained. Specifically, four causes, including task category, word count, number of task lists, and whether the task was illustrated, directly affect IVE. We further discuss these findings from a theoretical perspective and suggest three propositions: a) nudge-like intervention of a task list, b) subjective (perceived) low task complexity, and c) attraction of task presentation, alleviating the IVE problem. This study contributes to the literature on volunteer engagement in the CHC context and sheds new light on the design and implementation of collaborative digital humanities projects. © 2022",Causal inference,Cultural heritage crowdsourcing,Digital humanities,Imbalanced volunteer engagement,Task content characteristics,,,,Zhang X.,Zhang W.,Zhao Y.C.,Zhu Q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A survey has been conducted on the available Arabic datasets and previously proposed techniques and algorithms. The Balamand dataset presents an important challenge due to the geo-historical identity of manuscripts and their physical conditions. An advanced Deep Learning system was developed and tested on three different Latin and Arabic datasets: ICDAR19, ICFHR20 and KHATT, before testing it on the Balamand dataset. The system was compared with many other systems and it has yielded a state-of-the-art performance on the new challenging images with 95.2% mean Average Precision (mAP) and 98.1% accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Arabic manuscripts,Artificial intelligence,Document analysis,Historical documents,Writer identification,,,,Chammas M.,Makhoul A.,Demerjian J.,Dannaoui E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The role of born digital data in confronting a difficult and contested past through digital storytelling: the Waterford Memories Project,0,10.1007/s00146-021-01372-0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85125080515&doi=10.1007%2fs00146-021-01372-0&partnerID=40&md5=6f803511e5944dde3ae72ba7290a7ead,"Digital scholarship is ubiquitous, where even the most Luddite of scholars use some form of digital technology in their research. Differences in the level of technology use have become a question of degree not kind. Currently in the second wave of Digital Humanities, Presner (2010) argues that Digital Humanities 2.0 introduces entirely new-born digital paradigms, methodologies, and publication models not derived from print culture. This new wave is “deeply generative, creating the environments and tools for producing, curating, and interacting with knowledge that is ‘born digital’ and lives in various digital contexts” (Presner 2010, para. 13). Using the case study of a Digital Humanities project called “The Waterford Memories Project”, this paper will consider both the role of born digital survivor testimony in confronting a difficult and disputed past in Ireland and, more broadly, how we create and access knowledge in this contested space. The Waterford Memories Project is an oral history driven study in digital humanities, publicly documenting survivor narratives of the Magdalene Laundries and Industrial Schools in the South-East of Ireland. The last Magdalene Laundry in Ireland closed in 1996. These institutions formed part of a system of coercive confinement, which incorporated a wide range of historical institutions used to confine both children and adults whose “crimes” were to act against the strict and punitive moral codes of the period, poverty, or mental illness. This paper will examine the role of born digital data in public humanities (in the form of the audio-recorded survivor oral histories), and frames the Waterford Memories digital humanities project in the technoculture and minimal computing literature, emphasising the overall need for a human-centred approach to technology at all stages of the research. Cultural stories can become fossilised and continue to perpetuate the silencing of survivors; it is therefore essential to consider how the openly available digital testimony contributes to the framing of cultural discourse around our history of coercive confinement in Ireland. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Archives,Digital humanities,Industrial schools,Magdalene laundries,Testimony,,,,O’Mahoney J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How are digital archives made and what are their goals? How do different participants in the process work together in collaborative teams towards shared ideals? This paper outlines the methodological and political considerations that underlie the creation of a critical digital archive of historical and born-digital materials relating to 20th-century publishing history, The Modernist Archives Publishing Project (MAPP). Here we outline the archival practices and critical ethos that have informed the collaborative creation of MAPP by an international team of scholars, archivists, cultural institutions, students, and copyright estate holders. We address issues of selection that arise in creating a critical digital archive; feminist critical metadata practices; and our approaches to workflow and copyright; and conclude with an example of an archival document type in which the issues of feminist critical curation and copyright collide. © 2022, The Author(s).",Collaboration,Copyright,Curation,Digital humanities,Feminism,Metadata,,,Wilson N.,Battershill C.,Clarkson H.,Hannah M.N.,Nokhrin I.,Willson Gordon E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has produced a valuable but under-utilised source of large-scale digital data ripe for interrogation by scholars and practitioners in the Digital Humanities. However, current digitisation approaches fall short of the requirements of digital humanists for structured, integrated, interoperable, and interrogable data. Linked Data provides a viable means of producing such data, creating machine-readable archival data suited to analysis using digital humanities research methods. While a growing body of archival scholarship and praxis has explored Linked Data, its potential to open up digitised and born-digital archives to the Digital Humanities is under-examined. This article approaches Archival Linked Data from the perspective of the Digital Humanities, extrapolating from both archival and digital humanities Linked Data scholarship to identify the benefits to digital humanists of the production and provision of access to Archival Linked Data. It will consider some of the current barriers preventing digital humanists from being able to experience the benefits of Archival Linked Data evidenced, and to fully utilise archives which have been made available digitally. The article argues for increased collaboration between the two disciplines, challenges individuals and institutions to engage with Linked Data, and suggests the incorporation of AI and low-barrier tools such as Wikidata into the Linked Data production workflow in order to scale up the production of Archival Linked Data as a means of increasing access to and utilisation of digitised and born-digital archives. © 2021, The Author(s).",Artificial Intelligence,Cultural heritage,Digital archives,Digital humanities,Linked data,,,,Hawkins A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Development and application of a digital humanities research platform for biographies of Malaysian personalities,0,10.1108/EL-01-2022-0007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130113803&doi=10.1108%2fEL-01-2022-0007&partnerID=40&md5=3b9e627ac4ca4e4bd722e07b66257e43,"Purpose: Digital humanities research platform for biographies of Malaysia personalities (DHRP-BMP) was collaboratively developed by the Research Center for Chinese Cultural Subjectivity in Taiwan, the Federation of Heng Ann Association Malaysia, and the Malaysian Chinese Research Center of Universiti Malaya in this study. Using The Biographies of Malaysia Henghua Personalities as the main archival sources, DHRP-BMP adopted the Omeka S, which is a next-generation Web publishing platform for institutions interested in connecting digital cultural heritage collections with other resources online, as the basic development system of the platform, to develop the functions of close reading and distant reading both combined together as the foundation of its digital humanities tools. Design/methodology/approach: The results of the first-stage development are introduced in this study, and a case study of qualitative analysis is provided to describe the research process by a humanist scholar who used DHRP-BMP to discover the character relationships and contexts hidden in The Biographies of Malaysia Henghua Personalities. Findings: Close reading provided by DHRP-BMP was able to support humanities scholars on comprehending full text contents through a user-friendly reading interface while distant reading developed in DHRP-BMP could assist humanities scholars on interpreting texts from a rather macro perspective through text analysis, with the functions such as keyword search, geographic information and social networks analysis for humanities scholars to master on the character relationships and geographic distribution from personality biographies, thus accelerating their text interpretation efficiency and uncovering the hidden context. Originality/value: At present, a digital humanities research platform with real-time characters’ relationships analysis tool that can automatically generate visualized character relationship graphs based on Chinese named entity recognition (CNER) and character relationship identification technologies to effectively assist humanities scholars in interpreting characters’ relationships for digital humanities research is still lacking so far. This study thus presents the DHRP-BMP that offers the key features that can automatically identify characters’ names and characters’ relationships from personality biographies and provide a user-friendly visualization interface of characters’ relationships for supporting digital humanities research, so that humanities scholars could more efficiently and accurately explore characters’ relationships from the analyzed texts to explore complicated characters’ relationships and find out useful research findings. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Biographies,Characters’ relationships analysis,Close reading,Digital humanities,Distant reading,Geographic information analysis,Malaysia personalities,,Chen C.-M.,Ling T.-S.,Chang C.,Hsu C.-F.,Lim C.-P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ontology will facilitate reasoning on and across these documents and enable their semantic querying. The tagset of annotations, concepts, relations, and terms of the ontology will be both human and machine readable, extensible and reusable. The annotated corpus of texts to be produced will be available for sophisticated queries based on the concepts and relations, defined by the ontologies.

It has been widely recognized that DH can help in curating and analysing large amounts of data. However, digital tools can also support research processes in the humanities that are interested in detailed analyses of how empirical sources are patterned. Following a methodological differentiation between close and distant reading with regard to textual analysis, this article describes the Edumeres Toolbox, a digital tool for textbook analysis. The Edumeres Toolbox is an outcome of the continuous interdisciplinary exchange between computer scientists and humanist researchers, whose expertise is crucial to convert information into knowledge by means of (critical) interpretation and contextualization. This paper presents a use case in order to describe the various functionalities of the Edumeres Toolbox and their use for the analysis of a collection of Arabic textbooks. Hereby, it shows how the interaction between humanist researchers and computer scientists in this digital process produces innovative research solutions and how the tool enables users to discover structural and linguistic patterns and develop innovative research questions. Finally, the paper describes challenges recognized by humanist researchers in using digital tools in their work, which still require in-depth research and practical efforts from both parties to improve the tool performance. © 2022 by the authors.",Arabic language,digital humanities,quantitative and qualitative research,textual analysis,,,,,Fallucchi F.,Ghattas B.,Spielhaus R.,De Luca E.W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But much work in text analytics focuses on helping people investigate other textual units, such as events, clusters, ranked documents, entity relationships, or thematic hierarchies. Informed by a study into the needs of historians and archivists, we thus propose ClioQuery, a text analytics system uniquely organized around the analysis of query words in context. ClioQuery applies text simplification techniques from natural language processing to help historians quickly and comprehensively gather and analyze all occurrences of a query word across an archive. It also pairs these new NLP methods with more traditional features like linked views and in-text highlighting to help engender trust in summarization techniques. We evaluate ClioQuery with two separate user studies, in which historians explain how ClioQuery's novel text simplification features can help facilitate historical research. We also evaluate with a separate quantitative comparison study, which shows that ClioQuery helps crowdworkers find and remember historical information. Such results suggest possible new directions for text analytics in other query-oriented settings. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Among other benefits, these tools can foster a deeper understanding of fine arts, ultimately supporting the spread of culture. However, most of the systems proposed in the literature are only based on visual features of digitized artwork images, which are sometimes only integrated with some metadata and textual comments. A Knowledge Graph (KG) that integrates a rich body of information about artworks, artists, painting schools, etc., in a unified structured framework, can provide a valuable resource for more powerful information retrieval and knowledge discovery tools in the artistic domain. To this end, in this paper we present ArtGraph:1 an artistic KG based on WikiArt and DBpedia. The graph already provides knowledge discovery capabilities without having to train a learning system. In addition, we propose a novel KG-enabled fine art classification method based on ArtGraph, which is used to perform artwork attribute prediction tasks. The method extracts embeddings from ArtGraph and injects them as “contextual” knowledge into a Deep Learning model. Compared to the state-of-the-art, the proposed model provides encouraging results, suggesting that the exploitation of KGs in combination with Deep Learning can pave the way for bridging the gap between the Humanities and Computer Science communities. © 2022 The Author(s)",Artificial intelligence,Computer vision,Deep learning,Digital humanities,Fine arts,Graph neural networks,Knowledge graphs,,Castellano G.,Digeno V.,Sansaro G.,Vessio G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a time when Beijing increasingly seeks to bolster its discursive power and have the Chinese story properly told, the interpreter-mediated and televised Premier-Meets-the-Press conferences constitute a typical discursive event and regime of truth in articulating China’s officially sanctioned “voice.” Discursive in nature, the institutionalised event permits Beijing to construct a desired version of truth, fact and narrative in front of the more vociferous and dominant West. As an attempt to employ digital humanities (DH) methods to real-world language use, this corpus-based CDA study explores the press conference interpreters’ agency and mediation in rendering key concepts and discourses (e.g., ECONOMY and REFORM) constitutive of the broader Reform and Opening-up meta-narrative, which legitimises China’s political and economic systems, developments, policies and positions in the post-1978 era. The interpreters are found to maintain and often further reinforce Beijing’s discourse in English at various levels. Apart from indicating issues of institutional alignment, this study points to interpreters’ agency in communicating beyond national borders, (re)constructing political and institutional knowledge, counterbalancing the naturalised and taken-for-granted Western narratives, and contributing to the shifting East-West power differentials discursively. This study highlights the significance of interpreters as indispensable (re)tellers of the Chinese story in an increasingly mediat(is)ed world, where the interpreted discourse is routinely quoted verbatim on various platforms and taken for granted as the correct version of Beijing’s official “voice.”.

An ad hoc data set consisting of YouTube videos featuring teen dads has been built and analyzed through the approach of social media critical discourse studies, which combines theories and concepts belonging to the traditions of CDA and digital humanities. Preliminary results indicate that YouTube dads negotiate their identities as fathers, males, and teenagers by trying to reconcile the contradictions and expectations that characterize masculinity, fatherhood, and adolescence/adulthood discourses.

Various types of citation analysis have been proposed in the literature such as direct citation, co-citation and bibliographic coupling. Networks based on these citation analysis types have been used to reveal discipline structure, central players and emerging trends in STEM and social sciences. However, in the humanities large-scale citation network analysis is still underexplored, mainly due to the lack of comprehensive data sources and varying publication practices. In this paper, we investigate the unique characteristics and needs of citation analysis in the historical humanities and propose a generic framework for systematic generation and analysis of different types of citation networks based on several variables and the essential distinction between citations of primary and secondary sources. The proposed methodology was applied to a corpus of over 15,000 (both primary and secondary) books related to the research field of ancient Mediterranean religions. The obtained results show that in order to gain a deep and comprehensive understanding of a discipline’s structure it is beneficial to compare and combine the findings of several types of networks rather than focus on a single network analysis. Comparative community analysis of the networks reveals the existence of a disciplinary core only in the primary literature corpus and a hierarchical sub-discipline structure of the examined research field. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Betweenness centrality,Citation analysis,Community analysis,Digital humanities science mapping,Humanities,Network analysis,Primary sources,,Blidstein M.,Zhitomirsky-Geffet M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we develop a novel statistical modelling strategy to describe the enslavement of people given documented violent conflict, the transport of enslaved peoples from their location of capture to their port of departure, and—given an enslaved individual's location of departure—that person's probability of origin. We combine spatial prediction of conflict density via kriging with a Markov decision process characterising intra-African transportation. The results of this model can be visualised using an interactive web application to plot—for the first time—estimated conditional probabilities of historical origins during the African diaspora.

In order to map key approaches and explore intellectual foundations, we propose the canon as a term. It can be understood as a set of authors’ actions, relations, and circumstances (like institutions) that result in texts and concepts accepted in a particular research field. Moreover, vice versa, the texts and concepts circulate in the organizations and influence them. The canon makes it possible to map the boundaries of an interdisciplinary field, distinguishing it from others and, at the same time, from the disciplines it inherits. The authors draw attention to the traditional approaches used to describe research fields: sociology of knowledge, self-descriptions of the field, and an appeal to the way research is carried out in a particular field. The second part of the paper attempts to reconstruct three histories of scholars significant in Internet Studies, clarifying the discussions in which they participated and demonstrating how the canon in internet studies was formed. Institutional factors and the theoretical resources contribute here to understanding the boundaries of Internet Studies. The analysis of canon authors thus makes it possible to separate internet studies from the other fields, such as digital humanities or digital economics. The canon turns out to be a kind of infrastructure, directing internet studies researchers to some subjects and making it more challenging to address others. © 2022, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

The outcome of their work was a series of projections of the depletion of natural resources worldwide, with potentially dire consequences for the environment and the economy. Their report on their modelling and its projections was issued as a book in 1972, entitled The Limits to Growth. It created an immediate debate among scholars, policy makers, and other educated readers, and publications citing The Limits to Growth over its lifespan are voluminous. It continues to be cited 50 years after it was issued. The long citation period and the varied responses over time pose challenges for the book historian seeking to characterise the reception of the book. This article explores the ways in which book historians can use readily available citation analysis and visualisation tools to deepen understanding of a book's reception beyond the qualitative methods typically used in the secondary literature. The Web of Science's citation indexing and the HathiTrust collection's full-text searching capability are used to identify articles and books that have cited or referred to The Limits to Growth. Examples of the visualisations generated from the search results in each are included as illustrations of simple, accessible tools that the lone book historian can use when the scale of his or her work does not require the kind of computational analytics created to parse big textual data in digital humanities projects. © 2022 Vilnius University.

When building a digital library, should showcasing a representative slice of the physical collection be the goal? Should stakeholders focus on preservation, high-use items, or other concerns? To explore these conundrums, a special collections librarian and a digital services librarian performed a comparative analysis of their library’s physical and digital rare books collections. After exporting MARC metadata for the rare books from their ILS, the librarians examined the place of publication, publication date, and broad subject range of the collection. They used this data to create a variety of visualizations with the open-source digital humanities tool Tableau Public. Next, the authors downloaded the rare books metadata from the digital library and created illuminating data visualizations. Were the geographic, temporal, and subject scopes of the digital library similar to those of the physical rare books collection? If not, what accounted for the differences? The implications of these and other findings will be explored. © 2022.",,,,,,,,,McCormack A.,Wittmann R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tablets are typically found in the Middle East and were written by imprinting wedge-shaped impressions into wet clay. There is an increasing demand in the Digital Humanities domain for handwriting recognition, i.e., machine reading of handwritten script, focusing on historic documents. Current practice in text analysis of cuneiform script relies heavily on transliteration and translation, which are incomplete and influenced by the knowledge and experience of the expert that created them. The development of computational tools for cuneiform analysis presents many opportunities. An efficient and accurate sign spotting enables cross-referencing and statistical analyzes that are infeasible to perform manually. Furthermore, a wedge constellation spotting tool, provides experts with a significantly broader base of references to create more accurate and less time consuming transliterations and translations. Yet, cuneiform script has since resisted efforts to computational processing on basis of its basic constituents, its 3D wedge-shaped impressions and their free-form arrangements into signs. In this work, we review the literature on computational processing and recognition in the domain of cuneiform script. We introduce the different heterogeneous sources of cuneiform script, namely, manual ink-on-paper drawings, digital vector graphics drawings, photographs, and 3D scans of tablets. We describe the development of methods, beginning with the first computational classification using a hybrid manual encoding and computational comparison, to the latest methods making use of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks to recognize characters automatically. Finally, we give an overview of applications of these methods that enable quantitative mining in the small, e.g., patterns of wedge constellations, and in the large, e.g., networks of economic activity. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Cuneiform,similarity metrics,word-spotting,,,,,,Bogacz B.,Mara H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Toward a Period-specific Optimized Neural Network for OCR Error Correction of Historical Hebrew Texts,0,10.1145/3479159,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133692491&doi=10.1145%2f3479159&partnerID=40&md5=020f16aa9a65430283ee5d5795f5b866,"Over the past few decades, large archives of paper-based historical documents, such as books and newspapers, have been digitized using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. Unfortunately, this broadly used technology is error-prone, especially when an OCRed document was written hundreds of years ago. Neural networks have shown great success in solving various text processing tasks, including OCR post-correction. The main disadvantage of using neural networks for historical corpora is the lack of sufficiently large training datasets they require to learn from, especially for morphologically rich languages like Hebrew. Moreover, it is not clear what are the optimal structure and values of hyperparameters (predefined parameters) of neural networks for OCR error correction in Hebrew due to its unique features. Furthermore, languages change across genres and periods. These changes may affect the accuracy of OCR post-correction neural network models. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new multi-phase method for generating artificial training datasets with OCR errors and hyperparameters' optimization for building an effective neural network for OCR post-correction in Hebrew. To evaluate the proposed approach, a series of experiments using several literary Hebrew corpora from various periods and genres were conducted. The obtained results demonstrate that (1) training a network on texts from a similar period dramatically improves the network's ability to fix OCR errors, (2) using the proposed error injection algorithm, based on character-level period-specific errors, minimizes the need for manually corrected data and improves the network accuracy by 9%, (3) the optimized network design improves the accuracy by 3% compared to the state-of-the-art network, and (4) the constructed optimized network outperforms neural machine translation models and industry-leading spellcheckers. The proposed methodology may have practical implications for digital humanities projects that aim to search and analyze OCRed documents in Hebrew and potentially other morphologically rich languages. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.",dataset generation,digital humanities,DNN,Hebrew,historical newspapers,neural machine translation,OCR post-correction,,Suissa O.,Zhitomirsky-Geffet M.,Elmalech A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The project is developing a knowledge graph (KG) to facilitate information retrieval and discovery over the reconstructed items. The project decided to adopt Semantic Web technologies to support its distributed KG and reasoning. In this article, we present our approach to KG generation and management. We elaborate on how we help historians contribute to the KG (via a suite of spreadsheets) and its ontology. We furthermore demonstrate how we use named graphs to store different versions of factoids and their provenance information and how these are serviced in two different endpoints. Modeling data in this manner allows us to acknowledge that history is, to some extent, subjective and different perspectives can exist in parallel. The construction of the KG is driven by competency questions elicited from subject matter experts within the consortium. We avail of CIDOC-CRM as our KG's foundation, though we needed to extend this ontology with various qualifiers (types) and relations to support the competency questions. We illustrate how one can explore the KG to gain insights and answer questions. We conclude that CIDOC-CRM provides an adequate, albeit complex, foundation for the KG and that named graphs and Linked Data principles are a suitable mechanism to manage sets of factoids and their provenance. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",digital humanities,Knowledge graph creation,knowledge graph management,,,,,,Debruyne C.,Munnelly G.,Kilgallon L.,O'Sullivan D.,Crooks P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His proposed test for intelligence remains influential. In this paper, I propose to analyze his conception of intelligence by relying on traditional close reading and language technology. The Turing test is interpreted as an instance of conceptual engineering that rejects the role of the previous linguistic usage, but appeals to intuition pumps instead. Even though many conceive his proposal as a prime case of operationalism, it is more plausibly viewed as a stepping stone toward a future theoretical construal of intelligence in mechanical terms. To complete this picture, his own conceptual network is analyzed through the lens of distributional semantics over the corpus of his written work. As it turns out, Turing’s conceptual engineering of the notion of intelligence is indeed quite similar to providing a precising definition with the aim of revising the usage of the concept. However, that is not its ultimate aim: Turing is after a rich theoretical understanding of thinking in mechanical, i.e., computational, terms. © 2022 by the author.

This technique forms the basis of a movement model in order to calculate some approximate travel times between the two cities. Having some sense of the speed and ease at which the two cities could communicate with each other creates a baseline on which to understand how decisions of political importance were made and how the geographies of communication were reconfigured in late antique and early medieval Italy. © 2022 by the Regents of the University of California.

Data integration across digital repositories has several challenges. First, data heterogeneity in terms of data schema and data values usually occurs across diverse data sources. Second, heterogeneity in data representation and semantic issues are among the problems. The same data may appear in different repositories with varied data representations, i.e., metadata schema. Recent research has focused on matching several related metadata schemas. In this paper, a metadata integration framework is proposed to support digital repositories in socio-cultural anthropology at the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Anthropology Centre (SAC), Thailand. The proposed framework is defined based on the Metadata Lifecycle Model (MLM). It utilizes non-procedural schema mappings to express data relationships in diverse schemas. A case study of metadata integration over the SAC digital repositories was conducted to validate the framework. The SAC common metadata schema was designed to support data mapping across 13 digital repositories. The SAC “One Search” system was developed to exemplify the system implementation of the framework. Evaluation results showed that the proposed metadata integration framework can support domain experts in socio-cultural anthropology in unified searching across the repositories. © 2022 by the authors.

At the same time, these methods and tools introduce a dependence on technology, often resulting in a need for technical skills and expertise.

Therefore, researchers often depend on technical experts to develop and apply digital methods, which can create a bottleneck and hinder the broad use of digital methods in empirical bioethics research. Objective: This study aimed to develop a research platform that would offer researchers the means to better leverage implemented digital methods, and that would simplify the process of developing new methods. Methods: This study used a mixed methods approach to design and develop a research platform prototype. I combined established methods from user-centered design, rapid prototyping, and agile software development to iteratively develop the platform prototype. In collaboration with two other researchers, I tested and extended the platform prototype in situ by carrying out a study using the prototype. Results: The resulting research platform prototype provides three digital methods, which are composed of functional components. This modular concept allows researchers to use existing methods for their own experiments and combine implemented components into new methods. Conclusions: The platform prototype illustrates the potential of the modular concept and empowers researchers without advanced technical skills to carry out experiments using digital methods and develop new methods. However, more work is needed to bring the prototype to a production-ready state. ©Manuel Schneider.",bioethics,computational methods,digital bioethics,digital health,digital humanities,digital methods,digital platform,empirical bioethics,Schneider M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It uses data on personal (composer-to-composer) musical influences to generate and analyze network graphs. Data on style influences and composers ‘ecological’ data are then combined to composer-to-composer musical influences to build a similarity/distance matrix, and a multidimensional scaling analysis is used to locate the relative position of composers on a map while preserving the pairwise distances. Finally, a support-vector machines algorithm is used to generate classification maps. This article falls into the realm of an experiment in music education, not musicology. The ultimate objective is to explore parts of the classical music heritage and stimulate interest in discovering composers. In an age offering either inculcation through lists of prescribed composers and compositions to explore, or music recommendation algorithms that automatically propose works to listen to next, the analysis illustrates an alternative path that might promote the active rather than passive discovery of composers and their music in a less restrictive way than inculcation through prescription. © 2022, The Author(s).",Digital humanities,Multidimensional scaling,Music heritage and education,Music information retrieval,Musicological data visualization,Network graphs,Similarity indices,Support-vector machines,Georges P.,Seckin A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second part looks at questions of style and literary quality in the DPRK through a comparative analysis of multiple novels grouped by degree of literary prestige. It introduces a method to evaluate the originality of an author's writing style using a masked language model (BERT) and uses it to assess the role of conformity and originality in the DPRK's literary field. Even though writers consecrated by the state display a high level of stylistic conformity when writing mandated biographies of the ruling family, their independent output ranks higher in originality than nonconsecrated writers.

HEXIFE is an extension of HMTL5 that includes markup specifically devoted to different aspects of interactive fiction, such as hyperlinking, choice points, personalization, stretchtext, annotations, conditional content, and gamification. This DSL, which can be easily extended with new interactive fiction behaviors, is supported by a runtime environment based on conventional web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Web Components, PHP, and MySQL). IFDBMaker, in turn, piggybacks in a widely used web-based HTML editing framework (TinyMCE) to allow the creation of interactive HEXIFE fiction through a user-friendly approach. A postmortem evaluation shows how: (i) the approach makes the feasibility of supporting interactive fiction on conventional web technologies apparent; and (ii) the approach is a feasible one to actively involve writers in the final production of interactive fiction that are distributed and played through the web. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Authoring tool,Digital edition,Digital humanities,Domain-specific language,Interactive fiction,Web technologies,,,Gómez-Albarrán M.,Sarasa-Cabezuelo A.,Sierra-Rodríguez J.-L.,Temprado-Battad B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the required amount of traditional archival work makes historical network studies usually small-scaled. We consider the problem of processing a large corpus of unstructured textual information to extract network data. The corpus consists of almost 170,000 documents of administrative correspondence of the Portuguese Empire, from 1610 to 1833, catalogued in the Portuguese Overseas Archives of Lisbon. Our contribution is twofold: the method and the result. Firstly, grounded in the review of manual, semi-manual and automatic methods of network data extraction from natural language corpora, we propose and demonstrate an approach using modern natural language processing algorithms. This approach tries to mimic traditional archivist's coding practices and is applicable to large corpora of texts, for which manual coding is infeasible because of scale. We believe our approach is generic and adaptable to other substantive contexts, languages, and types of historical archives. Secondly, the dataset created is rich in additional information such as occupation, administrative affiliation, and geographical location of senders and recipients. We provide a preliminary network analysis suggesting that the dataset is an attractive material for historians and social network researchers for addressing research questions about the political and social evolution of the early modern Portuguese Empire, spanning the reign of seven Portuguese monarchs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Colonial studies,Correspondence networks,Digital humanities,Early modern letters,Historical network research,Natural language processing,Portuguese empire,,Błoch A.,Vasques Filho D.,Bojanowski M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly, it considers some significant switches from the qualitative to the quantitative, namely in the direction of experimental methods in «neuroarthistory» and of distant viewing in «digital art history». At the same time, adopting a perspective anchored in the history of ideas, it strives to exhibit the historical roots of such contemporary methodological trends in the background of the 19th and 20th century art-historical and aesthetic approaches. © 2022 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

This essay proposes the meshing of an autoethnographic sensibility with digital humanities. I narrate a portion of my methodological and interpretative processes as extracted from a larger project, “Mapping Modernity’s Slavery,” which utilizes digital mapping methods to visualize and analyze the constitutive spatiality of modern tourism, representations of luxury, and the (en)slave(d) body in antebellum New Orleans. The project plots more than 100 points of sale of enslaved people, the addresses of the city’s major nineteenth-century hotels, and their relative density and proximity. I also deep map descriptions of these sites as rendered within Solomon Northup’s Twelve Years a Slave and Francis and Theresa Pulszky’s White, Red, Black, both published in 1853. As a way to avoid the reproduction of the slavocracy’s dehumanizing techniques (i.e., the reduction of humans to tabulations in account books, catalogues, bills of sale, etc.), the paper foregrounds how being attuned to the embodied practice, phenomenology, and affect of manipulating archival materials within software platforms critically reshapes the questions asked of the research project. I propose a critical autoethnographic deep mapping to ameliorate the racial limitations and distortions at the intersection of the archive, the map, and the digital. © 2022 American Anthropological Association.",affect,autoethnography,Blackness,deep mapping,digital humanities,,,,Staidum F.C.,Jr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the context of the EU H2020 research project RURITAGE, a resource ecosystem (RRE) of various integrated tools was created for shaping and addressing heritage-led knowledge and bottom-up strategies of local regeneration. More specifically, the RRE was conceived to provide local stakeholders with new methodologies and user-friendly tools based on bottom-up processes for identifying and actioning heritage and territorial features and turning these cultural natural values—as well as the gaps—into opportunities. This paper undertakes a comparative analysis of the integration of tools in other digital platforms for heritage practices and/or regeneration processes to explore the holistic approach to heritage knowledge and the effectiveness in engaging local stakeholders. In addition, it frames methodologies for local stakeholder and related needs identification. Through this comparative analysis among digital heritage platforms and through user profiling to target the needs of users by using the RRE as a case study, the paper explores the challenge of helping communities to shape a local heritage-led collaborative knowledge supported by integrated and user-friendly digital tools and to activate them in preserving and exploiting their territories and building shared and plural cultural heritage understandings, considering cultural heritage as a social need. © 2022 by the authors.

So far, immersive technologies have not been used in academia to create research focused applications for exploring, analysing, and understanding WA within their inscribed space, including providing access to appropriate spatial and temporal contexts. Thus, we collaborate closely with researchers from the humanities to create interactive and immersive applications for the novel field of WA research. The results of our preliminary user study show high ratings in the sense of presence in the virtual environments and indicate that immersive spatial context could add new perspectives for understanding WA.

This paper presents this basic distinction, then explores ways to resolve this tension with the help of two interdisciplinary case studies, taken from preregistration in contemporary science and the debate over whig history in the history of science. These case studies, the paper argues, refocus our attention from a mutually exclusive testing/discovery binary to the relationship between our background data or philosophical views and the empirical generalizations that we might draw from the data. Finally, it develops a set of three challenges for philosophers and corresponding avenues for future work that will, it is hoped, allow us to better justify our use of these methods. © 2022 Metaphilosophy LLC and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",digital humanities,digital philosophy,hypothesis testing,philosophy of science,preregistration,whig history,,,Pence C.H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To bridge this huge gap in our knowledge (three orders of magnitude in time scales), it appears attractive to consider historical data: In Far Eastern sources, we searched for brightening events at different epochs but similar positions that possibly refer to recurrent nova eruptions. Probing a sample of ∼185 Asian observations from ∼500 BCE to 1700 CE, we present a method to systematically filter possible events. The result are a few search fields with between 2 and 5 flare ups and typical cadences between 102 and 103 years.

This work is based on an interdisciplinary approach, combining methods from digital humanities and computational astrophysics when applying our previously developed methods in searches for classical novae among Far Eastern guest stars.

Additionally, participatory approaches, which often rely on web information systems as their supportive infrastructure, have made an impact on the most recent historiographical trends, in particular in the methodological framework of digital humanities. The aim of this paper was to produce, from an ope-rational and implementation perspective, a review of software solutions frequently used to develop web information systems for research projects in humanities and cultural heritage, in order to provide an understanding of the various possibilities available and their positives and limitations, also based on different users’ requirements. An individual and comparative analysis of sixteen different application frameworks commonly used in these fields, either generic or developed for a specific research domain, has been carried out, considering their main functionalities, strengths, and weak-nesses. The achieved results facilitate critical and reasoned decision-making among several available options, guiding the makers of those systems, both researcher(s) and developers(s), and providing them also with a common ground of terms and use cases to facilitate their necessary dialogue. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Integrating hyperreal literature with CALL in English language curriculum for engineering studies in India: an empirical study of the impact on students’ learning,0,10.1108/WJE-07-2021-0393,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85119264891&doi=10.1108%2fWJE-07-2021-0393&partnerID=40&md5=f19b7dca0dd8455d4aadc36b24270653,"Purpose: Scholarship on language teacher knowledge and critical digital literacy. Using a grounded theory approach, semi-structured online presentations of students, classroom observations and their responses to multimedia tools such as movies and literature were analysed. As part of the study, 150 students pursuing undergraduate degree in engineering were assigned two assignments involving science fiction movies and hyperreal literature as part of an experiential strategy. A survey was conducted before and after the study to evaluate the change in students’ perception towards the use of technology and multimedia in language classrooms as well as their awareness of technological dependency in the postmodern world. The findings show that student cognition of AI and technological dependency is a complex and emergent system, and that, despite current literacy education scholarship stressing digital literacy as a social and critical praxis, technology is treated in a mostly functional, rather than a critical manner in a standard university language classroom. The results of this study suggest that the disadvantages of a realistic approach to teaching digital composition can be avoided by creating other forms of educational materials that adhere to critical digital literacies sense, such as posthuman literary works and science fiction film. Design/methodology/approach: This study is primarily qualitative and empirical, focussing on the analysis of student responses to classroom assignments and semi-structured online presentations and responses to multimedia tools such as movies and online literature. A pilot study was performed among the engineering students of Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore, India, to better understand engineering students’ perceptions and attitudes towards teaching English as a second language using emerging technology, with the aim of improving language abilities, writing skills, imagination and overall personality. One hundred and fifty (150) students were assigned two assignments as part of an experiential strategy. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft Teams was used as the platform for assessment and observation. As part of their learning challenge, students were required to watch the movies “Her”, “Interstellar” and “Bandersnatch” and write a technical report outlining some of the major observations on technology and AI. Secondly, as part of their learning challenge, students were required to read Oliver Sacks’ “The Machine Stops” and comment on his perspectives on technological dependency. This was supplemented by assessment tests and assignments focussing on the digital nature of the global education system. Another survey was conducted at the end of the study to evaluate the change in students’ perception towards the use of technology and multimedia in language classrooms as well as their awareness of technological dependency in the postmodern world. Owing to the posthuman and hyperreal nature of the movies and texts, students were introduced to the theories of Marshall McLuhan and Jean Baudrillard to better understand the chosen works. Findings: In the posthuman era, where digital technologies are at their peak, English language teachers select appropriate teaching resource materials based on the needs of the students and do their utmost to combine them with technology to make their teaching more engaging and efficient. Thanks to the current craze for Digital Humanities, not just English language teaching but also literature classroom teaching has experienced several paradigm shifts. This has raised the need for English teachers and professionals on the job market. Given this context, and in particular, to raise knowledge among engineering students of their critical position in the literary job sector, two tasks were assigned to students in the Language Classroom. These tasks included integrating technology into language studies and literature, instilling imagination, honing literary skills and facilitating the development of a comprehensive approach to life and potential endeavours. Originality/value: As evident from the study and literature review, the introduction of emerging technology in Language Classrooms has grown in popularity, but it has yet to be incorporated into Language Classrooms that focus on the comprehensive development of students, especially in India. Furthermore, proof of interactions between digital learning and teaching practices and anticipated results, effects and impacts was gathered to make the Language Classroom more social, inspiring and engaging, but little more. As a result, we see a lot of potential for research in this field, particularly concerning the most recent language studies advancements about Digital Humanities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Blended learning,Digital technologies,Hyperreality,Multimodal,Posthumanism,,,,Ajeesh A.K.,Rukmini S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent advances in technology, along with more affordable hardware coupled with more user-friendly interfaces, have seen widespread adoption beyond that of the military and healthcare. In fact, higher education institutions are poised to adopt VR on a broader scale to enhance learning with virtual environments. This study seeks to determine the expectations and results of integrating virtual reality into coursework with students and faculty in Art History. The study surveyed students, first to ascertain the prevalence and familiarity of immersive reality technologies, as well as the perceived benefit of integration into curriculum. Next, surveys collected data on student experience relating to virtual reality assignments integrated into coursework for both face-to-face and online learners. The results provide a model for other institutions for a variety of disciplines to reinforce outcomes through strategic use of the technology. © 2022, North American Business Press.

It was not until the late 1970s that AHA presidents began to explore the histories of women and people of color in any depth; before then, addresses gave short shrift to whole swaths of the human population, and many of these talks promoted a triumphalist view of United States history. Today people outside the academy encounter cutting-edge historical scholarship by way of their daily newspaper, blogs and online news sites, TV and films, the Broadway stage, historic places, debates over renaming streets and removing statues, and genealogy projects. At the same time, historians face challenges from budget-cutting administrators (in universities, libraries, and museums) and from cynical politicians who seek to replace truth with myth, in the process roiling state legislators and members of local school boards. Consequently, historians today contend with two major opposing forces - on the one hand, a proliferation of lively venues that bring inclusive stories about the past to a wider audience, and, on the other, political conditions that lead to the intimidation of historians regardless of where they work. In the face of these challenges, the AHA must continue its robust advocacy work on behalf of all historians. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

The preceding article articulated the need to move beyond the mapping of literary texts onto geographic sites in the world and into the mapping of space relationally in nonreferential ways by means of literary topology. This second article seeks to make a larger case for new ways of working in the digital humanities and suggests that new methods of analysis and new tools are needed. It articulates an integrated visual–verbal method of interpretation that combines the close reading of spatial meanings and structures within a text with analysis of the map series generated out of that same text in an iterative structure. It also argues for the value of layers of mapping and of comparative mapping of the same place both referentially and nonreferentially. The literary texts chosen to exemplify the method are Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There.

The article then raises a series of factors, covering both experiences, memoirs and novels of First World War captivity in Russia and also Nazi propaganda, to show a long-standing association between Siberia and German captivity in Russia and the Soviet Union. Finally, the article explores West German politics and memory culture to argue ultimately that the trope of Siberian captivity persisted as a result of West German anti-Communist policies and an attempt to displace blame and complicity for the war. While German memory changed between the 1950s and the present and although scholars have worked to expose many misrepresentations of the war that started in West Germany in the 1950s, this is the first study to examine the idea of Siberian captivity and its links to POWs in the USSR. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Before similarities are used for training an actual machine learning model, we would like to verify that they are bound to meaningful patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose to make similarities interpretable by augmenting them with an explanation. We develop BiLRP, a scalable and theoretically founded method to systematically decompose the output of an already trained deep similarity model on pairs of input features. Our method can be expressed as a composition of LRP explanations, which were shown in previous works to scale to highly nonlinear models. Through an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that BiLRP robustly explains complex similarity models, e.g., built on VGG-16 deep neural network features. Additionally, we apply our method to an open problem in digital humanities: detailed assessment of similarity between historical documents, such as astronomical tables. Here again, BiLRP provides insight and brings verifiability into a highly engineered and problem-specific similarity model. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",deep neural networks,digital humanities,explainable machine learning,layer-wise relevance propagation,Similarity,,,,Eberle O.,Buttner J.,Krautli F.,Muller K.-R.,Valleriani M.,Montavon G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article we will attempt to show this relationship by analyzing six of Dostoevsky's greatest novels, written through the entirety of his career. We are analyzing these novels using Distant Reading in conjunction with Close Reading, tools that are commonly used in the field of digital humanities, which enabled us to show visually the extent of F.M. Dostoevsky's engagement with this topic. The study poses two research questions: 1. To what extent did the writer use the more denigrating term ""Zhid""? 2. Can we see a correlation between the writer's portrayal of Jews with the definition of Anti-Semitism as it was known during his era? The obtained results show that there is clearly a correlation between the definition of anti-Semitism as it was understood at the time of Dostoevsky and the ""Jew""as depicted in his novels, as the financial motif is paramount in the depiction of Jews as this is the central topic in 49% of the negative sentences in which the word ""Jew""appears, with 59% of these sentences classified as stereotypes. The negative financial stereotype constitutes 32% of the entire corpus. In addition, we found the term ""Zhid""is commonly used by the writer, a variation of which constitutes 75% of the total terms used to depict Jews. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",digital humanities,distant reading,Dostoyevsky,Fyodor Mikhaylovich,,,,,Nirenberg Y.,Prebor G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This tradition was particularly strong during the Nordic Bronze Age (1700–550 BC) in southern Scandinavia with over 20,000 boats and thousands of humans, animals, wagons, etc. This vivid and highly engaging material provides quantitative data of high potential to understand Bronze Age social structures and ideologies. The ability to provide the technically best possible documentation and to automate identification and classification of images would help to take full advantage of the research potential of petroglyphs in southern Scandinavia and elsewhere. We, therefore, attempted to train a model that locates and classifies image objects using faster region-based convolutional neural network (Faster-RCNN) based on data produced by a novel method to improve visualizing the content of 3D documentations. A newly created layer of 3D rock art documentation provides the best data currently available and has reduced inscribed bias compared to older methods. Several models were trained based on input images annotated with bounding boxes produced with different parameters to find the best solution. The data included 4305 individual images in 408 scans of rock art sites. To enhance the models and enrich the training data, we used data augmentation and transfer learning. The successful models perform exceptionally well on boats and circles, as well as with human figures and wheels. This work was an interdisciplinary undertaking which led to important reflections about archaeology, digital humanities, and artificial intelligence. The reflections and the success represented by the trained models open novel avenues for future research on rock art. © 2021, The Author(s).",3D documentation,Digital humanities,Faster R-CNN,Machine learning,Rock art,Visualization,,,Horn C.,Ivarsson O.,Lindhé C.,Potter R.,Green A.,Ling J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AM integrates the mental lexicon with world knowledge, as for example, acquired via reading books. Following pioneering work by Denhière and Lemaire (2004), here, we computed DSMs based on a representative corpus of German children and youth literature (Jacobs et al., 2020) as null models of the part of the AM that represents distributional semantic input, for readers of different reading ages (grades 1–2, 3–4, and 5–6). After a series of DSM quality tests, we evaluated the performance of these models quantitatively in various tasks to simulate the different reader groups' hypothetical semantic and syntactic skills. In a final study, we compared the models' performance with that of human adult and children readers in two rating tasks. Overall, the results show that with increasing reading age performance in practically all tasks becomes better. The approach taken in these studies reveals the limits of DSMs for simulating human AM and their potential for applications in scientific studies of literature, research in education, or developmental science.

These services rely on a metadata-aggregation solution for bringing the digital objects’ metadata from the providing institutions into ROSSIO. The aggregated datasets are converted into linked data and undergo an enrichment process based on controlled vocabularies, which are developed and published by ROSSIO. The paper will describe this process, the applications involved, and how they interoperate. We will further reflect on how these services may enhance the dissemination of science, considering the FAIR principles. © 2022 by the authors.

Works of crosswriters, authors who write for both readerships in different works, are an excellent source for this research. This article applies stylometry, the computational method of analysing style, to the oeuvres of 10 Dutch and English crosswriters to trace potential differences in their individual style and similarities between the authors. The analyses also take into account the age of the intended reader (as listed in the paratext) and the publication date, to study the influence these aspects have on writing style. Four case studies zoom in on a specific author or age category of the intended readership to study general tendencies as well as outliers. The results from the stylometric analyses are complemented with peritextual information about the author’s view on style and writing for readerships of different ages. The main conclusion drawn from the case studies is that the style of the texts usually correlates more strongly with the age of the intended reader than with the time period in which it was written. Young adult literature clusters more closely with adult literature. The style associated with a younger readership is distinct in the oeuvres of most authors studied in this article and even transcends the differences between authors. © The Author(s) 2022.",Children’s literature,crosswriters,digital humanities,distant reading,intended reader,style,Stylometry,,Haverals W.,Geybels L.,Joosen V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within Digital Humanities, images are playing a more prominent role in research. For mass analysis of digitized historical images, bias can be introduced in various ways. One of them is the printing technology originally used. The classification of images to their printing technology e.g. woodcut, copper engraving, or lithography requires highly skilled experts. We have developed a deep learning classification system that achieves very good results. This paper explains the challenges of digitized collections for this task. To overcome them and to achieve good performance, shallow networks and appropriate sampling strategies needed to be combined. We also show how class activation maps (CAM) can be used to analyze the results. © 2021, The Author(s).",Deep learning in digital humanities,Historical image processing,Printing type classification,Shallow CNN,,,,,Im C.,Kim Y.,Mandl T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) dominate the field of automatic text analysis and natural language processing (NLP), in some cases presenting a super-human performance. DNNs are the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms solving many NLP tasks that are relevant for Digital Humanities (DH) research, such as spell checking, language detection, entity extraction, author detection, question answering, and other tasks. These supervised algorithms learn patterns from a large number of “right” and “wrong” examples and apply them to new examples. However, using DNNs for analyzing the text resources in DH research presents two main challenges: (un)availability of training data and a need for domain adaptation. This paper explores these challenges by analyzing multiple use-cases of DH studies in recent literature and their possible solutions and lays out a practical decision model for DH experts for when and how to choose the appropriate deep learning approaches for their research. Moreover, in this paper, we aim to raise awareness of the benefits of utilizing deep learning models in the DH community. © 2021 Association for Information Science and Technology.",,,,,,,,,Suissa O.,Elmalech A.,Zhitomirsky-Geffet M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to that, this study aims to develop a novel evaluation approach using five ontology indicators (data overview, visual presentation, highlight links, scalability and querying) to evaluate the knowledge structure presentation of cultural heritage ontology. Design/methodology/approach: The researchers collected and organized 824 pieces of government’s open data (GOD), converted GOD into the resource description framework format, applied Protégé and Gephi to establish and visualize cultural heritage ontology. After ontology is built, this study recruited 60 ontology participants (30 from information and communications technology background; 30 from cultural heritage background) to operate this ontology and gather their different perspectives of visual ontology. Findings: Based on the ontology participant’s feedback, this study discovered that Gephi is more supporting than Protégé when visualizing ontology. Especially in data overview, visual presentation and highlight links dimensions, which is supported visualization and demonstrated ontology class hierarchy and property relation, facilitated the wider application of ontology. Originality/value: This study offers two contributions. First, the researchers analyzed data on East Asian architecture with novel digital humanities tools to visualize ontology for cultural heritage. Second, the study collected participant’s feedback regarding the visualized ontology to enhance its design, which can serve as a reference for future ontological development. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cultural heritage,Digital humanities,Evaluating ontology,Ontology,Visual ontology,,,,Cheng Y.-J.,Chou S.-L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The premises of Situation Awareness (SA) and Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) are the theoretical lens for conducting the present study. The objective of the study is the probabilistic modeling of the SA of process operators by means of complementarity among the premises of SA and DSA during shift change. The methodology used semi-structured interviews that followed a questionnaire created to categorize verbalizations at the three SA levels. Verbalizations were analyzed with the “digital humanities” approach that allowed the integrated modeling of SA using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) theory. The research was performed in an industrial plant that carried out a polymer injection process, which was classified as a physical arrangement for the continuous manufacture of products. In this process, production was conducted in three continuous shifts with one operator per shift. As a result, the BBN modeling showed the dynamic relationships among the core variables monitored, and also demonstrated the complementarity between SA and DSA. In this sense, BBN was used as a communication protocol between shifts and served as a mechanism that influences the operator's cognitive load. The developed algorithm showed an excellent performance, because it represents the conditional probability between the variables according to the operators' indications regarding the criticality and level of monitoring of the process. The modeling allowed representing the operators’ complete SA, thus promoting DSA. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Bayesian Belief Network,Distributed Situation Awareness,Shift changeovers,Situation Awareness,,,,,Rosário C.R.,Amaral F.G.,Kuffel F.J.M.,Kipper L.M.,Frozza R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It introduces the concept of visual public memory through a study of the circulation of photographs of the Dutch anarchist movement Provo between 1967 and 2016. It demonstrates that the visual public memory of a movement can be captured in a network composed of carriers of memory (newspapers, magazines, exhibitions, books), memorata (the remembered events), and mnemonic actors (actors that circulate the carriers of memory). Based on a qualitative interpretation of this network, the article follows four routes through it, uncovering the role of seemingly a-political mnemonic actors, such as municipal governments and museums, in the visual public memory of Provo. Showing how photographs are uniquely able to carry political possibility into memory, this article argues that visual representation plays a crucial role in how social movements are remembered. © The Author(s) 2021.",anarchism,digital humanities,network analysis,public memory,social movements,,,,Smits T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Revisiting the digital humanities through the lens of Indigenous studies—or how to question the cultural blindness of our technologies and practices,1,10.1002/asi.24564,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85112355244&doi=10.1002%2fasi.24564&partnerID=40&md5=a008c9c615b1dd9731c0ddaf29a0db30,"This article examines the benefits of putting Indigenous perspectives and the digital humanities (DH) in conversation with each other in order to elaborate a DH approach that is suitable for Indigenous research and to suggest critical perspectives for a more sustainable DH. For this purpose, the article examines practices of data harvesting, categorizing, and sharing from the perspectives of groups in the margin, more specifically in relation to Sámi research. Previous research has emphasized the role of cultural and social contexts in the design, use, and adaptation of technologies in general, and digital technologies in particular (Douglas, 1987. Inventing American broadcasting; Nissenbaum, 2001. Computer, 34, 118–120; Powell & Aitken, 2011. The American literature scholar in the digital age) and several scholars have argued for how the application of critical studies make a fruitful contribution to the DH (Liu, 2012. Debates in the digital humanities; McPherson, 2012. Debates in the digital humanities). This article suggests an approach that addresses a need to acknowledge the diversity of technoscientific traditions. The perspectives of Indigenous groups bring this matter to a head. In order to make the DH more sustainable and inclusive, the development of the DH should be driven by cultural studies to a greater extent than it has been so far. A sustainable DH also means a better rendering of the plurality of the cultural values, perspectives, and ethics that characterize our fieldwork and research subjects. © 2021 The Author.

Blackwell; 2004) and its position in the overall academic landscape are still being negotiated. While there are countless essays and opinion pieces that debate the status of DH, little research has been dedicated to exploring the field in a systematic and empirical way (Poole, Journal of Documentation; 2017:73). This study aims to contribute to the existing research gap by comparing articles published over the past three decades in three established English-language DH journals (Computers and the Humanities, Literary and Linguistic Computing, Digital Humanities Quarterly) with research articles from journals in 15 other academic disciplines (corpus size: 34,041 articles; 299 million tokens). As a method of analysis, we use latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling, combined with recent approaches that aggregate topic models by means of hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Our findings indicate that DH is simultaneously a discipline in its own right and a highly interdisciplinary field, with many connecting factors to neighboring disciplines—first and foremost, computational linguistics, and information science.

Inscription serves as a fundamental rhetorical device in research outputs and practices. As many inscriptions are deeply rooted in a scientific research paradigm, they can be used to evaluate the level of scientificity of a scientific field. This is specifically helpful to understand the relationships between research traditions in digital humanities (DH), a highly cross-disciplinary between various humanities and scientific traditions. This paper presents a quantitative, community-focused examination of how inscriptions are used in English-language research articles in DH journals. We randomly selected 252 articles published between 2011 and 2020 from a representative DH journal list, and manually classified the inscriptions and author domains in these publications. We found that inscriptions have been increasingly used during the past decade, and their uses are more intensive in publications led by STEM authors comparing to other domains.

Then we discuss the application of the search system and the corpora to study how politicians talk about power, how ideological terms are used in political speech, and how to identify narratives in the data. All case studies stem from questions in the humanities and the social sciences, but rely on the grammatically parsed corpora in both identifying and quantifying passages of interest. Finally, the paper discusses the role of natural language processing methods for questions in the (digital) humanities. It makes the claim that a digital humanities inquiry of parliamentary speech and interviews with politicians cannot only rely on computational humanities modeling, but needs to accommodate a range of perspectives starting with simple searches, quantitative exploration, and ending with modeling.

Prior to the Nakba, the Palestinian literary landscape experienced a small-scale local nahda in the form of adab maqalat (periodical literature) rather than adab mu’allafat (monograph/book-form literature). However, due to the ruptures of 1948, this formative period of adab maqalat has been unexplored and remains disconnected from Palestinian literary histories.

Currently, researches about the sentiment analysis of songs are mainly based on lyrics, audios and lyric-audio. Recent studies have shown that deep spectrum features extracted from the spectrogram, generated from the audio, perform well in several speech-based tasks. However, studies combining spectrum features in multimodal sentiment analysis of songs are in a lack. Hence, we propose to combine the audio, lyric and spectrogram to conduct multimodal sentiment analysis for ICH songs, in a tri-modal fusion way. In addition, the correlations and interactions between different modalities are not considered fully. Here, we propose a multimodal song sentiment analysis model (MSSAM), including a strengthened audio features-guided attention (SAFGA) mechanism, which can learn intra- and inter-modal information effectively. First, we obtain strengthened audio features through the fusion of acoustic and spectrum features. Then, the strengthened audio features are used to guide the attention weights distribution of words in the lyric with help of SAFGA, which can make the model focus on the important words with sentiments and related with the sentiment of strengthened audio features, capturing modal interactions and complementary information. We take two world-level ICH lists, Jingju (京剧) and Kunqu (昆曲), as examples, and build sentiment analysis datasets. We compare the proposed model with other state-of-the-arts baselines in Jingju and Kunqu datasets.

We first outline Pask’s discovery of possibilities of a neoclassical cybernetic framework for human–human, human–machine, and machine–machine conversations. Second, we outline conversation theory as an elaboration of the reconstruction of mental models/concepts by observers through reliance on sociocultural psychological approaches, and apply concepts like the zone of proximal development and perezhivanie to Paskian aesthetic technologies. Third, we interpret Pask’s teaching/learning devices as zones of proximal development, and outline how Paskian algorithms in digital devices like THOUGHTSTICKER have been generalized on today’s internet, supplemented by corporate interests. We conclude that Paskian theory may offer understandings of the roles of internet technologies in transforming human thinking, and suggest (re)designing tools incorporating algorithms that contextually advance conceptual understanding that deviates from current indexing approaches. © The Author(s) 2022.",constructivism,cybernetics,digital humanities,internet,Vygotsky,,,,Tilak S.,Glassman M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Web application for data collection in marketing strategies: an approach from the perspective of Digital Humanities.,0,10.4108/EETSIS.V9I5.2611,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138161591&doi=10.4108%2fEETSIS.V9I5.2611&partnerID=40&md5=fde08f6ff953dfc8db724af4bb173cf8,"INTRODUCTION: Web applications and information systems are predominantly constituted as platforms for acquiring data and services over the Internet. Such applications integrate a technological context filled with intelligent devices interactive amongst themselves, connected to the network, hardware, and software, and accessible to the most varied social segments. OBJECTIVES: This article aims to present a digital mechanism based on product marketing for the acquisition of personal data used by a company in the cosmetics industry; to characterize privacy and data protection in view of the regulatory acts prevailing in Brazil; as well as to discuss how such scenarios affect the consumer. METHODS: We performed a bibliographic survey with a qualitative approach to the information collected, and used a digital platform for commercial operation as object to analysis. RESULTS: We confirmed the use of a digital platform, accessible by different electronic devices, to spread commercial content reaching a considerable volume of users, which then propagated it. We verified an indirect relationship of supply of goods through the transfer of identification, communication and location data. We identified users being directed to the Terms of Promotion and User Privacy Policy, as well as different media resources aiding their understanding. CONCLUSION: The customer's vulnerability in consumer relations stands out, something increasingly frequent in digital environments, which enables a directly proportional flow of information between market and consumer. Finally, we observed that Digital Humanities constitute a broad field of research under an extensive methodological domain, due to its interdisciplinary character, for the digital study of cultural phenomena, and promote critical reflection on the effects that computational methods have on society. © 2022 Aldine do Socorro Corrêa Cruz et al.",. digital humanities,Advertising,Free products,Gdpr,Information system,Personal data,Privac,,do Socorro Corrêa Cruz A.,Alvarez E.B.,Vital L.P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It presents results obtained with the help of a computer program developed for the automated analysis of strophic syntax. The program was created using Boris Tomashevsky’s method based on analyzing the punctuation at the end of poetic lines (the strength of the syntactic pause is evaluated depending on the absence or presence of a punctuation sign: i.e., a comma, a dash, a semicolon, or a full stop / question mark / exclamation mark). We supplemented this with two more indices also based on punctuation. The first characterizes the length of sentences (the percentage of sentences in one line, two lines, three lines, etc.), and the second characterizes the number of sentences that end with a full stop, which comes in the middle of a line followed by the beginning of the next sentence in the same line (or, which is the same, the number of such lines). This study demonstrates that both the number of lines with a strong pause in the middle and the number of short sentences have increased over time © 2022,Studia Metrica et Poetica.All Rights Reserved",Digital humanities,Quantitative methods,Rhythm,Sonnet,Stanzaic syntax,Strophic syntax,Syntax,,Belousova A.,Rueda J.S.P.,Charris P.R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particular attention is paid to the European Research Infrastructure Consortia (ER-ICs), as well as to other projects and initiatives in the field of digital social sciences and humanities (SSH). The development of digital infrastructure for these areas of scientific knowledge is one of the political priorities of the European Commission and other EU bodies. Aside from contribution to the effectiveness of the European Research Area (ERA), support of digital SSH indirectly contributes to the strengthening of supranational institutions and European identity. At present, there are grounds to identify the existence of a digital infrastructural basis of the European Knowledge Area. In this regard, the importance of the EU experience for the future development of digital infrastructure in Russia and the EAEU countries is growing. The creation of consortiums of the digital scientific infrastructure within the EAEU and the expansion of opportunities for funding of collaborative research projects are important directions in strengthening integration processes and developing the scientific potential of the post-Soviet countries.

A method of constructing a fine-grained sentiment lexicon for the humanities computing of classical chinese poetry,0,10.1007/s00521-022-07690-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136950722&doi=10.1007%2fs00521-022-07690-8&partnerID=40&md5=0ceb2d7f7fe4e019054e846a4dfa0a1d,"In Chinese classics, the sentiment attitudes or thoughts of the ancients regarding specific environments, people, and events were generally expressed in the form of poetry. Compared with previous attempts to classify the polarity of poetry, sentiment terms can be used to detect more fine-grained humanity knowledge in literary information resources. However, the existing techniques of domain sentiment lexicon construction fail to take full advantage of deep learning and linguistic knowledge, which cannot ensure the term integrity and accuracy. To this end, this work proposes a novel approach for the construction of a sentiment lexicon via the combination of supervised sentiment term extraction and classification, aiming at incorporating multi-dimensional linguistic knowledge into a two-phase deep learning model. A character-sequence labeling model for term extraction is first constructed by fusing the emotion radical features of Chinese characters, and term embedding augmentation via word knowledge is then carried out to classify the extracted terms. Experiments on Chinese poetry and its appreciation texts validate the superiority of the proposed method, and the model incorporating linguistic knowledge is found to outperform the benchmark models in different metrics. A fine-grained sentiment lexicon with two first classes, five-second classes, 15 third classes, and 14,368 domain terms and unregistered terms is constructed via hierarchical term classification, thereby contributing to the advancement of the interpretability of the humanities computing of classical Chinese poetry. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Deep learning,Digital humanities,Linguistic knowledge,Sentiment lexicon,Sentiment term classification,Sentiment term extraction,,,Zhang W.,Wang H.,Song M.,Deng S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These DLs aim at sharing the research outcomes, in several cases as FAIR data, and at creating linked information spaces. In several cases, to reach these aims the Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data have been used. This paper presents how the current scientific DLs in the DH field can provide the creation of linked information spaces and navigational services that allow users to navigate them, using Semantic Web technologies to formally represent, search and browsing knowledge. To support the argument, we present our experience in developing a scientific DL supporting scholars in creating, evolving and consulting a knowledge base related to Medieval and Renaissance geographical works within the three years (2020–2023) Italian National research project IMAGO—Index Medii Aevi Geographiae Operum. In the presented case study, a linked information space was created to allow users to discover and navigate knowledge across multiple repositories, thanks to the extensive use of ontologies. In particular, the linked information spaces created within the IMAGO project make use of five different datasets, i.e. Wikidata, the MIRABILE digital archive, the Nuovo Soggettario thesaurus, Mapping Manuscript Migration knowledge base and the Pleiades gazetteer.

As two auxiliary methods in classical bibliography inter record and analytic record aim at recording the documents accurately and completely in the bibliography system according to the diversity of contents on the basis of the in-depth analysis of the content characteristics of the documents so as to achieve the function of “ once classes are divided academic ideas become clear. However the traditional methods of inter record and analytic record are mainly completed by human beings which leads to several issues such as low efficiency high cost weak scientificity weak objectivity and poor reliability etc. This study aims at introducing machine learning to classical bibliography under the perspective of digital humanities to provide a new implementation strategy forinter record and analytic record. The study first proposes to map inter record and analytic record of classical bibliography to the problem of text classification and puts forward a method framework based on machine learning to contribute countermeasures for the multi-category record of ancient books in the bibliographic system. This study takes the pre-Qin schools and representative books as the object to verify the method. Two machine learning models namely TextCNN and BERT are used to classify ten ancient books from six schools of pre-Qin dynasties and each school has one or two books correspondingly. The classification result shows that fine-tuned BERT model outperformed TextCNN model and can achieve 91. 64% of classification accuracy. The fine-tuned BERT model is then used to classify two controversial books namely Xunzi and Guanzi and the results of inter record and analytic record of two books are obtained. It is suggested that Xunzi should be classified to Legalism category and Confucianism category while Guanzi should only be classified to Legalism category. In particular this study also finds that the first 26 chapters of Xunzi are more inclined to Legalism and the last six chapters are more inclined to Confucianism. The innovations of this paper are mainly reflected in the following aspects it puts forward the method of inter record and analytic record based on machine learning and puts forward the method of text classification to distinguish the categories of ancient books from the particle size of books sections and chapters and to judge the ideological tendency of scholars.

Moretti’s methodology is given the most at-tention, it is presented as a complex of interrelated methods. The theory of cultural evolution, world-systems analysis, cultural geography, computational criticism of the digital humanities and distant reading are considered in detail. Moretti takes literary forms as an analogue of biological species and shows what cultural niches they occupy, how certain forms survive, how they interbreed with each other, how “unadapted” forms die off and what influences all these pro-cesses. Modern technologies make it possible to work with big data, and this provides new material for research (quantitative aspect), and also changes the ob-ject of research (qualitative aspect). Using cartographic and statistical methods, as well as the method of world-system analysis, Moretti shows that the study of world literature becomes the study of the struggle for symbolic hegemony in the world. The world-system approach in relation to literature and, more broadly, to culture as a whole makes it possible to understand exactly how the unity of world literature is combined with its unevenness and heteroge-neity. Therefore, the researcher’s field of vision includes not only established cultural forms (canon), but also what has been discarded by cultural evolution (the “Great Unread”), and this significantly changes the entire cultural picture of the world. Distant reading problematizes the value of the literary canon, strives for the maximum and exhaustive coverage of the corpus of texts. © 2022, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences.

Previously, such a study was undertaken by scholars using a purely visual approach and relied on images of objects or in-person observations. This paper’s approach is based on 3D scans of historical artefacts. Sample points are extracted from these 3D scans and the distance between analogous points across different objects is computed using an approximation of the Wasserstein metric, namely the Sinkhorn distance. In this paper, the approach is demonstrated on a small set of ancient Greek vessels of the Krater, Pelike, and Kylix types, as the variation in their shapes across time is well known to archaeologists. Results offer, for the first time, a way of quantifying differences between objects. Benefits of this approach lie in its ability to quantify change, to study complex 3D material, and to analyse large datasets of objects, opening the possibility of constructing new large-scale studies of object shape across time and geographical regions. These have a range of applications in art history, archaeology, digital humanities, museology and extended reality studies. © 2022 The Author(s).",3D models,archaeology,digital art history,digital humanities,shape comparison,Sinkhorn distance,,,Pala G.M.,Costiner L.S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the late 1980s, Asian victims of Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities (such as the infamous “comfort women” system) began to sue the Japanese government and corporations with the help of local and Japanese lawyers and activists. This paper uses the plethora of publicly available court materials produced by the movement to study social networks in this transnational historical justice movement and illustrate how graph database management systems can upgrade traditional network analysis methodologies in digital humanities. By inputting the data about lawsuits and lawyers in the movement into graph database applications like Neo4j and GraphXR, the paper demonstrates the advantages of managing network data in graph database structure in terms of scalability, modifiability, intuitive visibility, query efficiency, and analysis potential over relational database structure, which is the mainstream in network analysis research. © 2022 The Author(s).",graph database,human rights,Japanese history,relational database,reparation,social network analysis,visualization,,Pan K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To that end, the following have been listed and quantified: number of beasts, and regulated use by the muleteers of the Kingdom of Granada employing a methodology that combines source analysis with digital humanities (databases) and statistics. Given the the heterogeneous nature of the data, these are classified into five categories, depending on the information obtained with regard to regulation by traffic, muleteer or pack animal. To evaluate the economic impact of muleteering, the following were calculated: number of pack animals, uses at territorial (i.e. counties and towns) and individual level. Analysis of the data provides a starting point for a better understanding of muleteering in the Kingdom of Granada, and relates this activity to elements such as temporality, the commercial-economic hubs and the main internal communication routes. © 2022 Universidad de CastillaLa Mancha, Departamento de Historia.

Spatio-temporal Co-occurrence Visualization of Chronicle Based on Knowledge Reorganization: A Case Study of Zhu Xi’s Chronological Biography,0,10.13530/j.cnki.jlis.2022015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135415574&doi=10.13530%2fj.cnki.jlis.2022015&partnerID=40&md5=87519d2ab8c0e10dc8caa1313cb85b37,"Digital humanities provides a new paradigm and method for the study of chronological information of historical figures. “ Chronology and “ location are important information in the ancient chronological literature of a historical person. However because of the “chronological nature of chronological biography chronological information is easier to collect and use while location information is disordered and difficult to investigate. This characteristic causes humanists to emphasize “ chronology rather than “ location information in historical research. Humanists often conduct research in the order of time evolution while ignoring the systematic analysis of multiple factors such as person time and place. Therefore in order to realize the visual co-occurrence of “chronology and “location information in the chronological biography of a historical person this article built a visualization platform based on GIS technology. This article proposed a knowledge reconstruction scheme for chronological information text which includes a top-level conceptual design scheme event classification system event description scheme and event text processing principles and rules. Especially the event description scheme follows the style “general element + characteristic element. The general element focuses on time person location office and literature. Through this metadata scheme this article reorganizes the two-dimensional information “chronology and “space into one-dimensional. And then we used Zhu Xi’s Chronicles Biography as an example to validate this knowledge reconstruction scheme and develop a chronological visualization platform based on the GIS technology. The chronological visualization platform is the B / S structure. Its front-end is developed based on jQuery Leaflet Ajax and Bootstrap. The database is MySQL. Node. js is used to interact with the MySQL database. In addition the chronological visualization platform integrates external knowledge bases such as CBDB CHGIS etc. to complete entity information supplementation and entity information association. The chronological visualization platform uses events as the core to realize the co-occurrence of the two dimensions of time and space enriching the visualization methods of ancient texts. At the same time it also overcomes the inequality of “chronology and “space in the chronological biography which is conducive to the integration of “time and “space in the analysis and mining of chronicle events by humanists. The metadata representation scheme of knowledge reorganization proposed in this paper for Zhu Xi’s Chronicles Biography not only lays the foundation for the general metadata representation scheme of knowledge reorganization but also provides a method based on knowledge reorganization for the realization of group biography.

Digitalization of Ancient Books and Construction of Classical Knowledge Repository from the Perspective of Digital Humanities,0,10.13530/j.cnki.jlis.2022013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135411268&doi=10.13530%2fj.cnki.jlis.2022013&partnerID=40&md5=09a6fcacf60e24734f33bbea3b73601c,"“Digital humanities DH is a new paradigm of interdisciplinary research which introduces digital techniques and methods in traditional Humanities studies to study cultural phenomena in human society. At present “automatic punctuating “automatic tagging “automatic translating and “automatic collating of ancient books labeled as DH in traditional cultural research are paid great attention to. Yet necessary basic conditions of the research are deficient such as the large-scale corpus and related knowledge tools. As a result essential data of DH projects are almost self-made which is not only inefficient but also unexchangeable and incompatible. It also contradicts ideas of big data and the interdisciplinary research that are advocated by DH. Accordingly this paper makes some preliminary discussion of basic conditions of DH research in traditional cultural domain. The most basic conditions of DH research are the digitalization of ancient books which in essence is the digital conversion of physical books and OCR of texts is the key process of digitalization. The OCR of texts is to recognize and convert images of Chinese characters using computer encodings. It involves two aspects one is computer encodings of Chinese characters and the other is computer image recognition and conversion to characters. In view of current techniques we believe that apart from OCR of texts to improve the recognition rate also needs techniques in corpus vocabulary knowledge repository artificial intelligence and final manual recheck. Additionally as to the standards and unification of characters in ancient books a possible solution is to establish a comparison table of standardized form of Chinese characters and their variants for computers to do data analysis and character input and output. The requirements of textual processing of digitalization of ancient books in a usual sense and of DH research are different. The former generally demands reproduction of the original content while the latter requires processing of content including data statistics information and knowledge mining and so on. However the processing of punctuations quotations names of persons places and books in ancient books is quite complex and diversified which calls for a large-scale corpus to support. The knowledge repository is an intelligent system based on knowledge. The uppermost function of classical knowledge repository is to connect the ancient and modern times and help computers to understand ancient culture and literature correctly. The objectivity of “knowledge is emphasized which provides interpretation of the “knowledge in accordance with the ancient thinking and culture based on the understanding of ancient culture. We should give priority to knowledge repositories from the perspectives of language time geography systematization as well as attaching the past to the present. Knowledge repositories include not only those of names of persons places functionaries books and renowned items that belong to “explicit knowledge but also those that have “tacit knowledge characteristics such as repositories of academic histories intellectual histories literature art and other “ indefinable repositories. 1 fig. 1 tab. 16 refs. © 2022, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

From cipher to plain text? Topic modelling Swedish governmental reports 1945-1989,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85135162255&partnerID=40&md5=7b6dd281e4610588f18e8e58c1a15d9a,"In 2015 the National Library of Sweden finished digitising all Governmental Official Reports (SOU) from 1922 to 1999. Traditionally, SOU reports - and work performed within different governmental committees - were tasked with preparing the Swedish government for apt and rational decision-making. The range of subjects covered by governmental committees and SOU reports basically includes every area of the Swedish welfare state, from issues focused on migration and the environment to cultural and media policy. The article departs from an analysis of all SOU reports during 1945-89 as one massive dataset; in all 3,154 SOU reports that contain 87 million tokens. Research has been performed within a Jupyter Lab environment, a web application with executable Python code that can be run to perform data analysis. The Jupyter Lab environment has been developed at the digital humanities hub Humlab at Umea University, and research is related to the project Welfare State Analytics: Text Mining and Modelling Swedish Politics, Media 8c Culture, 1945-89. This is a digital humanities and digital history project that will digitise literature, curate already digitised collections, and perform research via probabilistic methods and text mining models. If all SOU reports were to be considered one single text written by the state, which themes in this vast text is software able to read and perceive? It is possible to answer such a broad question by way of topic modelling, a computational method to study themes in texts by accentuating words that tend to co-occur and together create different topics. Via co-occurrence, topic modelling creates topics in the form of clusters of similar words (topics); a term or a word may be a part of several topics with different degrees of probability. Topics also occur in relation to each other, and clusters and networks can be visualised by using software such as Gephi. The article focuses on topics related to media and media policy. Depending on how many topics a topic model displays - in the article models of 50, 100, 200, and 500 topics are used - different media topics can be detected. In the 50 model, one media topic was found, whereas in the 500 model, there were several, with more specific traits such as film censorship or daily press subsidies. One finding is that film was the single medium to which the SOU genre between 1945-89 devoted the most attention. Another finding is that archival issues were closely linked to media topics during the same period. Governmental committees and SOU reports on media were primarily focused on future-oriented policies, above all how media should be supported or regulated. Yet, archiving the same media forms was also something that the state was repeatedly interested in. In conclusion, the article explains what topic modelling is in general, how the method can be used in digital historical research - not least in relation to close reading - and how statistical analysis of the distribution of words in the form of topics can generate interesting results. The SOU data is rich; topics can be traced with many different themes. As a researcher, however, one must learn to work with data: to load different models into the Jupyter Lab environment, to compute various input values, change parameters, and often curate outcomes in a way that differs from traditional historical research practices. © 2022 Scandia.

This process of “topic modeling” cultural criticism will serve to illustrate the dominant subject matters present in the Romanian cultural press.

It is a transition in which the conception and use of language and grammar come to have fundamental ontological connotations, which can be appreciated very well in the contrast of the main texts of each author: Phenomenology of the spirit and Thus spoke Zarathustra, which have made up the corpus of this study. To observe their grammatical structures, an analysis using the new computational tools and approaches suggested from the most recent approaches of the digital Humanities has been seen opportune. It is a quantitative approach that tries to complement the close reading that a specialist can carry out. Specifically, natural language processing (known as NLP) has been applied, through a pre-trained model and by programming in R. It has been possible to detect the type of terms used in both texts, distinguishing their different grammatical functions, the dependencies between terms and the verb tenses. The article shows, quantitatively, how distant the two philosophers are and how they use grammar equally tenaciously to express and give to understand their ideas. From their philosophies it can be affirmed that grammar and ontology form a unit: grammar is used to reinforce philosophical ideas as much as these ideas are already derived, formed, in the grammatical structures themselves. Finally, computational tools prove to be, through this article, a pertinent complement for philosophical analysis. © Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.",Digital Humanities,Hegel,Nietzsche,NLP,Text Mining,,,,Cebral-Loureda M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Feasibility documents as critical structuring objects: An approach to the study of documents in digital research production,0,10.1177/13548565221111073,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134366796&doi=10.1177%2f13548565221111073&partnerID=40&md5=1ffd1d804c7ea2fbc53405cee979079e,"Documents have been increasingly recognised as important objects of investigation in Science and Technology Studies (STS); however, so far, much less attention has been given to the study of documents produced in Digital Humanities. The author proposes therefore to use the method of the ‘STS of documents’ and analyse Feasibility documents that aim to assess technical and design requirements based on research questions and to organise a project workflow. Drawing on the ethnography of King’s Digital Lab, the article investigates Feasibility documents produced by the lab within the Agile-based Software Development Lifecycle framework. The article aims to show that Feasibility documents (1) inform ethnographic work about lab workflow and management and in doing so, are able to capture the interconnectedness of work layers and practices; (2) enable an empirical analysis of digital research projects and the process of translation from research questions, to methods, to technical solutions; (3) are critical structuring objects that structure the research process and relationships between involved actors and are structured by local institutional strategies and decisions. The author conducts a ‘feasibility analysis’ that reveals the project management and development stages: the analytical process (the translation of research questions into technical solutions); the production process (the move from technical and design practices to research answers) and the infrastructure and management process (project workflow and sustainability solutions). Drawing on Agre’s critical technical practice and Digital Humanities’ theories of critical production, the article seeks to shift attention from end-product digital artefacts towards the complex process of their creation, which can unpack a range of social, technological and management issues. In doing so, it also aims to provide a methodological framework for the analysis of documents produced in Digital Humanities that have the potential to unearth new questions about the socio-technical nature of digital production. © The Author(s) 2022.",agile project management,critical technical practices,Digital humanities,digital research production,ethnography of documents,feasibility documents,infrastructure,king’s digital lab,Pawlicka-Deger U.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The term “Digital Indology” is used this term as an analogy of the expression “Digital Humanities”.

The main trends in the development of digital philosophical Indology are being outlined (viz. the formation of a unified computer database of Indian classical texts, the development of special programs that allow setting and solving new pertaining to the content, as well as historical tasks in the study of various texts of various groups, etc.) The use of mathematical statistics and the methods of contextual analysis are suggested as typical auxiliary methods while analyzing classical texts of India.

Methodology: The analysis of the characteristics of Omeka S has been carried out from a literature review, the information available on the website and the official documentation of the application, as well as through its installation, use, and analysis. The description of the application is complemented by a compilation of various international use cases in the field of digital humanities that showcase the versatility of the tool. Finally, a comparison is offered with five other free software applications available on the market: Omeka Classic, CollectiveAccess, Mukurtu, ResearchSpace and Arches. Results: Among the main strengths of Omeka S is its ease of installation, maintenance, and use, its multisite architecture, the ease of integrating vocabularies from the semantic web as ontologies, its flexibility to create description templates for digital objects, the freedom in the design of the pages that make up the public interface, or its native integration with other repository management systems such as DSpace or Fedora Commons, thus being able to be implemented as a platform for the management and publication of resources derived from the repository, or as a public access layer of the digital objects, respectively. On the other hand, managing a project with Omeka S requires a greater initial effort due to its great flexibility. Finally, the system is less competent at accessing the database, which cannot be done natively through SPARQL queries. © 2022 Universitat de Barcelona.

The model’s effectiveness is assessed in creating resources and digital language archives to support speaker communities and language documentation programmes for endangered and lesser-known languages in India. Design/methodology/approach: The model of SiDHELA, the first indigenous language archive developed in India at Sikkim University by the Centre for Endangered Languages in collaboration with the Central Library, is described. Findings: This study finds that localised repositories developed in collaboration with institutional libraries work as a more effective and accessible resource centre for indigenous communities, rather than the centralised data stores that collate all language data, which is the dominant method of language documentation in the world. Social implications: It is the authors’ belief that the active role of libraries in language documentation and preservation of indigenous knowledge will open future gateways for language revitalization for under-resourced languages of the world. Originality/value: SiDHELA is a novel attempt at localised digital language archiving in collaboration with indigenous communities of Sikkim and the North Bengal region of India. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Archives,Collaboration,Community centric approaches,Data management,Data management plans,Digital archives,Digital humanities,Digital libraries,R K.N.,Takhellambam M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frequency and Content of the Last Fifty Years of Papers on Aristotle’s Writings on Biological Phenomena,0,10.1007/s10739-022-09683-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133240869&doi=10.1007%2fs10739-022-09683-8&partnerID=40&md5=6a6dc04407880e99b043fc2a728a41ba,"Aristotle is often named as the first zoologist or biologist because of his writings on animals. Although Aristotle’s major intention in these books was to illustrate his ideas of how knowledge and understanding might advance, at least one modern biologist (C. Darwin) has recognized Aristotle's depth and breadth as being of surviving merit. Of greater surprise is the ongoing attention that his works continue to receive, including publications in contemporary scientific journals. This review identifies 38 peer-reviewed papers on various topics from Aristotle’s biological writings that have been published during the last 50 years. These papers are described according to content (genetics, population biology, anatomy, brain, movement), specific creatures (fish, scorpions, elephants, insects, birds), publication outlet, distribution over the fifty year period surveyed, and visible trends in the topics studied. It is concluded that, in the highly-competitive field of peer-reviewed scientific publication and citation, Aristotle's biology continues to excite the interest of scientists and remains salient to modern science itself. © 2022, The Author(s).",Aristotle,Biology,Citation analysis,Digital humanities,,,,,Sharpley C.F.,Koehn C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing studies have examined either a small number of cases from a limited period of the newly formed Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes’ history; answered a specific question over a longer period; or conducted detailed micro-studies of individual and high-profile cases. None have examined the surviving petitions made to the court (held at The National Archives under J 77) holistically over an extended period. This article seeks to revive the field by suggesting a new interdisciplinary methodological approach that will combine historical and legal studies with digital humanities to offer the first panoptic view of J 77 petitions. Far from being dry legal documents, this article argues that they hold a wealth of rich detail about petitioners, respondents, co-respondents, witnesses, children, solicitors, barristers, clerks, and judges, and stand at an exciting intersection of several fields of enquiry. Adopting such an approach will generate important new insights about gender, class, property ownership, intimacy, religion, childhood, and sexuality in nineteenth and early twentieth century England and Wales. © 2022 The Author(s).

It is the merging of conventional humanities fields like archaeology and history with computer-based tools and techniques as well as other conventional fields like linguistics and literature. Increase in digital cultural heritage data from museums, libraries, and so on requires new modes of analysis rather than standard representations of data. Though the field of online humanities was traditionally seen as a text-based one, researchers in fields like cultural heritage are increasingly using digital representations and visual analysis approaches to study their subjects. A country's cultural heritage (CH) preservation and management are important in preserving and enabling history analysis. There is a growing use of digital and visualization technologies in the documentation and preservation of cultural heritage sites. In this paper, we examine the importance of digital humanities methods, such as 3D reconstruction of cultural heritage and using analysis of variance to develop interactive educational platforms. With the help of the digital framework, CH has been examined and an interactive, open-access network for promoting education, heritage preservation, cultural management, and social responsibilities has been established. © 2022 Xixi Fang.",,,,,,,,,Fang X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Borchert Map Library was the ideal incubator for an experiment that has changed how a wide range of people are thinking about structural racism and the history of race in American urban environments. Mapping Prejudice used a cartographic visualization of racial covenants as the intellectual nexus of a project that transcended disciplinary boundaries and invited community members into cutting-edge research work. The Map Library provided the physical space, resources, and geospatial expertise necessary for community-driven mapping work. It also served as an intersectional hub necessary for this transformative research initiative, illustrating the synergies between map librarianship and other disciplines. The work depended on the unique contributions of the map librarian: project management; experience networking with researchers, campus departments, and community groups; and knowledge of best practices surrounding data management, curation, and reuse. This article explains how Mapping Prejudice changed academic scholarship and public understandings by engaging volunteers in meaningful research. It concludes by providing a description of future directions for this project and calls on librarians to lead more work of this kind. The example of Mapping Prejudice suggests ways that map librarians can be leading new modes of inclusive, equitable and community-responsive research. © 2022 The Author(s).

By distant reading and topic modeling a dataset of 3100 Swedish Government Official Reports between 1945 and 1989—a corpus of some 87 million tokens—the article gives a new perspective of how the Swedish state examined and discussed media in general and media politics in particular. Topic modeling is a computational method to study latent themes or discourses in a dataset by accentuating words that tend to co-occur and together create different topics. Via a computational interrogation of the dataset in a Jupyter Lab environment a number of media topics can be detected.

Unusually (for TikTok), it was about the trade in human remains. Thus, we were presented with the opportunity to watch how knowledge of the trade exploded into broader public consciousness on a comparatively newer platform. In this article, we scrape TikTok for reactions to that moment. In our previous research on the human remains trade on Instagram, we used a particular suite of digital humanities methods to understand how Instagram was being used by participants in the trade. Here, we employ those same methods to develop a case study for contrast. The original individual, whose TikTok account is used to promote his bricks-and-mortar business buying and selling human remains, has, as a result of this attention, gained an even greater number of followers and views, making the video a ""success.""Nevertheless, several users engaged in long discussions in the comments concerning the ethics of what this individual is doing. A number of users created videos to criticize his activities, discussing the moral, ethical, and legal issues surrounding the trade in human remains, which in many ways makes the ""success""of this video one of fostering opposition and a wider understanding of the ethical and moral issues around this trade. © 2022 Shawn Graham et al., published by De Gruyter.",computer vision,human remains,network analysis,social media,,,,,Graham S.,Huffer D.,Simons J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hierarchical topic analysis tool to facilitate digital humanities research,0,10.1108/AJIM-11-2021-0325,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128938467&doi=10.1108%2fAJIM-11-2021-0325&partnerID=40&md5=c8a0c9567e9225a70e0f095a0ff70cd1,"Purpose: This study aims to develop a hierarchical topic analysis tool (HTAT) based on hierarchical Latent Dirichelet allocation (hLDA) to support digital humanities research that is associated with the need of topic exploration on the Digital Humanities Platform for Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s Writings (DHP-LCLW). HTAT can assist humanities scholars on distant reading with analysis of hierarchical text topics, through classifying time-stamped texts into multiple historical eras, conducting hierarchical topic modeling (HTM) according to the texts from different eras and presenting through visualization. The comparative network diagram is another function provided to assist humanities scholars in comparing the difference in the topics they wish to explore and to track how the concept of a topic changes over time from a particular perspective. In addition, HTAT can also provide humanities scholars with the feature to view source texts, thus having high potential to be applied in promoting the effectiveness of topic exploration due to simultaneously integrating both the topic exploration functions of distant reading and close reading. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a counterbalanced experimental design to examine whether there is significant differences in the effectiveness of topic inquiry, the number of relevant topics inquired and the time spent on them when research participants were alternately conducting text exploration using DHP-LCLW with HTAT or DHP-LCLW with Single-layer Topic Analysis Tool (SLTAT). A technology acceptance questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were also conducted to understand the research participants' perception and feelings toward using the two different tools to assist topic inquiry. Findings: The experimental results show that DHP-LCLW with HTAT could better assist the research participants, in comparison with DHP-LCLW with SLTAT, to grasp the topic context of the texts from two particular perspectives assigned by this study within a short period. In addition, the results of the interviews revealed that DHP-LCLW with HTAT, in comparison with SLTAT, was able to provide a topic terms that better met research participnats' expectations and needs, and effectively guided them to the corresponding texts for close reading. In the analysis of technology acceptance and interview data, it can be found that the research participants have a high and positive tendency toward using DHP-LCLW with HTAT to assist topic inquiry. Research limitations/implications: The Jieba Chinese word segmentation system was used in the Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s Writings Database in this study, to perform word segmentation on Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s writing texts for topic modeling based on hLDA. Since Jieba word segmentation system is a lexicon based word segmentation system, it cannot identify new words that have still not been collected in the lexicon well. In this case, the correctness of word segmentation on the target texts will affect the results of hLDA topic modeling, and the effectiveness of HTAT in assisting humanities scholars for topic inquiry. Practical implications: An HTAT was developed to support digital humanities research in this study. With HTAT, DHP-LCLW provides hmanities scholars with topic clues from different hierarchical perspectives for textual exploration, and with temporal and comparative network diagrams to assist humanities scholars in tracking the evolution of the topics of specific perspectives over time, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the overall context of the texts. Originality/value: In recent years, topic analysis technology that can automatically extract key topic information from a large amount of texts has been developed rapidly, but the topics generated from traditional topic analysis models like LDA (Latent Dirichelet allocation) make it difficult for users to understand the differences in the topics of texts with different hierarchical levels. Thus, this study proposes HTAT which uses hLDA to build a hierarchical topic tree with a tree-like structure without the need to define the number of topics in advance, enabling humanities scholars to quickly grasp the concept of textual topics and use different hierarchical perspectives for further textual exploration. At the same time, it also provides a combination function of temporal division and comparative network diagram to assist humanities scholars in exploring topics and their changes in different eras, which helps them discover more useful research clues or findings. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities,Digital humanities research platform,Hierarchical topic modelling,Information visualization,Text mining,Topic analysis,,,Chen C.-M.,Ho S.-Y.,Chang C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article makes both methodological and substantive contributions to understanding how these influential recommendation algorithms work. We conducted a sequential analysis of historical and contemporary iterations of Spotify and Tinder's Privacy Policies and Terms of Use to ascertain the extent to which it is possible to use this sort of analysis to infer functionalities of the algorithmic recommendations. Our results offered certain insights into the companies, such as Spotify acknowledging in its Privacy Policy that companie's commercial agreements may be altering the recommendations. However, the legal documentation of both companies is ambiguous and lacks detail as to the platform's use of AI and user data.

The structural and functional analysis of the poetic text, which the Formalists themselves called ""morphological"" is the nucleus of the Formalist agenda, and it can indeed be considered ""qualitative"". However, the thesis of quantitative formalism's novelty is only partially true. To demonstrate this, the author focuses on the approaches to quantitative poetics developed by two members of the Moscow Linguistic Circle, Boris Tomashevsky and Boris Yarkho, and, in particular, on Yarkho's invention of what was later referred to as ""distant reading"". Apart from its historical significance, a comparison of these two versions of quantitative formalism offers new methodological insights that can be applied by researchers in contemporary digital humanities. © 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

The survey, completed by top managers of companies from different sectors of the EE countries' economy, helped form a system of indicators for assessing the level of DT by country. The systematization of the DT factors made it possible to differentiate them by the nature of influence, advantages, and threats of the DH (digital humanities) for the EE countries. The results indicated a low and medium level of DT in the countries studied because of the lack of a digitalization strategy. A matrix of business digitalization management strategies has been formed for Eastern European countries, considering the efficiency level, digitalization threats, and the priority in their management. It will help mitigate the threats of DT and reduce the digital divide with countries with a high level of DT. © 2022, Institute of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

More specifically—in the context of Environmental Humanities and regarding biocultural diversity—a key challenge is to set effective and engaging ways of rapid knowledge generation for public awareness and policy-making. According to the 2019 United Nations report on biodiversity, the world will lose one million species in the upcoming years. In parallel, it is acknowledged that the degradation of biological diversity also threatens cultural and linguistic diversity, as declared by UNESCO. In an attempt to contribute to knowledge safeguarding this diversity, a hybrid approach combining the tradition of participatory design with DH tools and with the collaboration of a variety of scholars and stakeholders, has resulted in the co-creation of a manifesto on “biodiversity in connection with linguistic and cultural diversity”. We outline the design thinking methodology applied for this experimental case study, and in parallel apply software-aided discourse analysis of the manifesto co-writing process—from a “sprint” collaborative writing format to an online publication, moving from a face-to-face context into digital collaboration channels. Results highlight the importance of facilitation, flexibility and adequate ways of visualization “in progress” (via analogue materials and DH tools) during the co-writing sprint process, as well as the need to set basic co-creation protocols in such transdisciplinary context, considering synchronous and asynchronous collaboration. We discuss the importance of advancing between DH and sustainability-driven experimental co-creation, connecting practices with opportunities to develop collaborative writing and knowledge generation in the margins of academic settings. © 2022 The Author(s).

We use a literary corpus composed of more than 200 books of Brazilian literature (about 5 million words) and present a quantitative and qualitative analysis that takes the gender element as an analytical operator, selecting one of its dimensions: characterizations attributed to female and male characters. Searching for linguistic structures indicative of predication, we distinguished four axes of analysis (appearance, emotion, character e social role), expanding a type of research that is normally restricted to case studies. Using computational tools, we switch the glasses that bring the text to a close or a distant reading, making the best of each of these perspectives. The results reinforce the idea of female characterization centered on appearance (specifically on beauty), but also signal the importance of taking into account not only the high frequency elements of the corpus. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.

Through semi-structured interviews conducted with eight librarians from four universities, along with observation of their actual work and investigation of the library websites, this study explored these librarians' perceptions of DH pedagogy and their understandings about the role of “DH librarian.” The findings show that the role of a DH librarian can be seen as a liaison among different stakeholders, a group of specialists, or a collective title. The importance of humanities versus technical backgrounds and the practical skills a DH librarian needs to support DH pedagogy are discussed. The findings also indicate that an ideal practice of DH pedagogy requires balanced collaboration, a clear framework, a closer partnership, ample investment in human and technical resources, and high valuation of non-book scholarship. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",Academic libraries,Definition,Digital humanities librarian,Digital humanities pedagogy,Qualities,,,,Yao W.,Xiao P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Digital Archive of Ordinary Writings (Early Modern in Spain and Portugal) project, which led to the formation of a digital epistolary corpus—now available online—from funds preserved in judicial archives during the Modern Age in the Iberian Peninsula. Based on a practical case, the paper reflects on the reality of the fieldwork carried out in order to build a digital corpus, as well as on its strengths and weaknesses, which allows a first-hand insight of some changes and challenges of the digital revolution we are immersed in. Methodology: Advances in the field of Digital Humanities are taken as a starting point to examine the multidisciplinarity that characterizes both the corpus formation process and the possibilities for its analysis and study. Originality: The paper describes the complete work process involved in the transformation of primary sources into digital sources in an innovative project in the field of Digital Humanities; it also reflects on problems faced by historians in working with private letters produced by common people (sixteenth-nineteenth centuries), which range from the location of these sources to their selection, digitization, editing, treatment, and subsequent study. Conclusions: In addition to describing the process of transforming sources into a digital corpus and the possibilities of its analysis, the article evidences different analytical ways. Likewise, it addresses the wealth of archives as essential repositories for recovering private and ordinary epistolary sources while also reflecting on the future of their conservation in the digital environment. © 2022, Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

Novel computational tools allow to study differences in magazines content taking into account all available articles. In this study, we analyse the case of two Argentinian magazines published by the same publishing house over a decade (2008–2018), advertised by the publishing house as targeting women and men respectively. Using computational tools, we are able to analyse more than 24,000 articles, which would have been an impossible task using manual content analysis methodologies. With Topic Modelling techniques we identify the main themes discussed in the magazines and quantify their different frequency between magazines over time. Then, we performed a word-frequency analysis to validate this methodology and extend the analysis to other subjects. Our results show that topics such as Family, Business and Women as sex objects present an initial bias that tends to disappear over time. Conversely, in Fashion and Science topics, the initial differences are maintained. Also, we identify a considerable increase in the use of words associated with feminism since 2015 and specifically the word abortion in 2018.

The if claim is addressed with a detailed rebuttal to Angus Fletcher's 'Why Computers Will Never Read (or Write) Literature.” A counter-argument based upon key AI concepts, the historical progress of AI, and landmark failures and breakthroughs brings readers up to date on the current state of AI as it relates to narrative studies. Numerous examples explain why the cycle of AI winters and springs is now broken, and there is a new global AI arms race. Scholars now have a windfall of increasingly sophisticated, multi-million dollar models that can analyze and generate narrative. Still, in light of the inherent complexity of natural language and the current limitations of even these state-of-the-art AI models, a human-in-the-loop is essential for the foreseeable future. We attempt to allay common yet misplaced concerns by reasserting the centrality of the human scholar to guide and interpret while using these tools. Leveraging these new AI models will yield new insights for narrative studies, and this important work will include shaping the language of fairness, equality, and ethics of models that increasingly impact the lives of billions. We invite narrative scholars to participate in this growing interdisciplinary movement that chooses active engagement over passive critique.

The exchequer generated a vast quantity of written documents recording its operations. This paper subjects one such document, detailing the sums received at the exchequer for the year 1301–2, to data science techniques in order to gain added insight into the routine functioning of the financial arm of English government in its oldest colony.

The generation thereof also no longer involves an explicit instruction from human to machine but can happen in real-time without human intervention. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive computing are being utilized to mine data from a variety of sources. One such (profitable) source is human beings. Digital algorithms are designed to harness the power of technology to gather information. There has always been a sense of secrecy regarding some information (classified, top secret, confidential, etc.) but the Fourth Industrial Revolution has created the means to gather extremely large amounts of data, unknown to its sources. Anthropological value systems should become a fundamental foundation of digital algorithms. Such an approach could prevent software from exploiting its sources, especially minorities. Value systems together with ethics are guided by people's culture. In ethically aligned algorithm design, value systems and digital technologies intersect and govern how algorithms are developed, the way data is engaged, and further the discipline of digital humanities. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence,COVID-19,digital algorithms,digital colonialization,ethically aligned design,invisible data,,,Lambrechts W.,Sinha S.,Mosoetsa S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beyond its research role, it is being seen as a collaborative way to engage teachers in deep professional development leading not only to changes in skill but also in purpose. Previous reviews of the approach, however, have offered only cautious optimism for the capacity of DBR to support widespread or scalable change. This paper will use methods drawn from the digital humanities and social sciences to explore patterns relating to regional differences, theoretical underpinnings, practical implementation and methodological choice in recent DBR research in the domain of mathematics education. The findings suggest that much of the work presented as DBR might be better characterized as ‘implementation studies’ as they contain only limited commitment to theoretical development capable of supporting the scaling of innovation. The exceptions appear to occur in settings with well-developed research capacity which recognizes the need for ontological innovation of theory whilst iteratively and comprehensively exploring the complexities of authentic learning interventions. An example of a rich mathematical research study using DBR is provided to point to the potential for this methodology to achieve its overarching aims more fully. © 2021, Mathematics Education Research Group of Australasia, Inc.",Design-based research,Digital humanities and social sciences,Mathematics education research,Meta-study,Research capacity,Theory development,,,Fowler S.,Cutting C.,Fiedler S.H.D.,Leonard S.N.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: The sample consisted of 26 Somali American emerging adult and older adult refugees who created digital stories as part of the Immigrant Stories Project (https://immigrantstories.umn.edu/). Stories were analyzed through an examination of narrative structure and content. Results: The structure of the authors’ stories was primarily progressive or stable, with very few regressive stories. Although the distribution of these story structures did not differ for emerging adults and older adults, there were important variations in content. Emerging adults’ stories reflected a struggle to find self-continuity across time and place, whereas older adults’ stories indicated attempts to find meaning and optimally adapt to their current situations. Moreover, none of the stories took on a redemptive structure, a type of story that has been identified as culturally prevalent in U.S. culture but seldom examined across diverse populations. Conclusions: The findings highlight the varieties of paths toward successful immigration and the importance of taking a collaborative, participatory approach to understanding migration experiences. © 2021.

A natural relationship exists between DH and the field of information studies (the iField), particularly surrounding their common focus on the interface between humans and computers, as well as subfields such as the organization of information, libraries and archives, data preservation, and information in society. Thus, we propose that iField programs in universities should take an active role in DH education. We are particularly interested in programs that are officially Information Schools (iSchools), members of the international iSchools Organization. Our research began as part of a DH curriculum committee convened by the iSchools Organization. To support iSchool engagement in DH education, we have inventoried and analyzed the degrees and supplemental credentials offered by DH education programs throughout the world. Our study deployed multiple data collection methods, which included conducting both ad hoc and comprehensive website surveys, querying an online DH catalog, and inviting members of the iSchools Organization to participate in an online questionnaire. This work has revealed several common patterns for the current structure of DH programs, including the various types of degrees or supplemental credentials offered. We observe that iSchools have a significant opportunity to become more engaged in DH education and we suggest several possible approaches based on our research. © 2022 The authors.

Individual texts plucked for reproduction from manuscript miscellanies are often encountered as fragments in secondary literature, isolated and compiled into subsequent gatherings of texts and images with their own respective functions. The practice of isolating these texts and images, as well as its intellectual motivations, has served to obscure our view of manuscript miscellanies and composites as material objects.

The lives of these “holy” women show great contact between court and convent, and they contribute to better understanding the history of women and their subsequent impact on society. The collected lives appeared in a diversity of sources: manuscripts of the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries, including conventual books and compendia containing lives of saints, handwritten and printed chronicles of religious orders in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Castile, and other works. Thus, the Catalogue recovers several texts that have never been printed before and that in most cases were never edited independently. Furthermore, it integrates the development of a database in order to understand the different proposed hagiographical models and their performative shape and spatial distribution of power. Additionally, this article discusses how gathering, editing, and reading the lives of these women via an open-access virtual tool creates a new hermeneutical framework regarding the materiality of the original codices and printed volumes. Finally, it proposes mitigation measures in the near future to bring contemporary reading practices (and interpretation) closer to historical ones. © 2021 The Author(s).

An ICH knowledge graph (KG) can help the public to understand the ICH and facilitate the protection of the ICH. However, a general framework of ICH KG construction is lacking now. In this study, we take the Chinese ICH (nation-level) as an example and propose a framework to build a Chinese ICH KG combining multiple data sources from Baike and the official website, which can extend the scale of the KG. Besides, the data of ICH grows daily, requiring us to design an efficient model to extract the knowledge from the data to update the KG in time. The built KG is based on the triple 〈entity, attribute, attribute value〉 and we introduce the attribute value extraction (AVE) task. However, the public Chinese ICH annotated AVE corpus is lacking. To solve that, we construct a Chinese ICH AVE corpus based on the Distant Supervision (DS) automatically rather than employing traditional manual annotation. Currently, AVE is usually seen as the sequence tagging task. In this paper, we take the ICH AVE as a node classification task and propose an AVE model BGC, combining the BiLSTM and graph attention network, which can fuse and utilize the word-level and character-level information by means of the ICH lexicon generated from the KG. We conduct extensive experiments and compare the proposed model with other state-of-the-art models. Experimental results show that the proposed model is of superiority. © 2021",Attribute value extraction,Digital humanity,Intangible cultural heritage,Knowledge graph,,,,,Fan T.,Wang H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These problems include the short-circuiting of dreams, automatization of thought, and toxic digital networks. Stiegler’s φάρμακον (pharmakon) seeks to treat the toxicity of the Anthropocene with a care-ful hermeneutic approach that is directed towards the disautomatized, inventive, co-individuating knowledge act. This paper first explores Stiegler’s Anthropocene and his development of Heideggerian ποίησις (poeisis) in terms of the challenge of the ‘bringing forth’ of knowledge acts, which are illustrated by free software. It then explores, through the additional example of free radio, of Félix Guattari’s work in free radio, the problem and possibility of creative co-individuating ex-pression in the Anthropocene by expanding on Stiegler’s emphasis on the importance of hermeneutics. This raises the question of how to read Stiegler’s own ex-pression of the future of knowledge. Next, the paper reviews Stiegler’s educational project involving a dis-automatizable hermeneutic web. Finally, the paper gives an autoethnographic account of an attempt to ‘bring forth’ learning through the implementation of free software in local, online classrooms. The free software example does not solve the problem of the Anthropocene but does raise the question of our responsibility to choose our digital tools care-fully and the importance of maintaining the possibility of co-individuating ex-pression like the kind that is remembered in song and which online education should remind us of. © 2021 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.",co-individuation,critical pedagogy,digital humanities,hermeneutics,mythopoeisis,Negentropy,,,Goetz G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Writing in large quantities on the issues of machine learning, digital library, text mining, and digital humanities, Underwood has long been committed to the interdisciplinary studies of literature. In his monograph Distant Horizons: Digital Evidence and Literary Change (2019), Underwood makes an exploration of how digital methods can help us describe and comprehend the larger arcs of literary change across longer time spans. During her visit to the University of Washington (2019-2020), Feng Lihui carried out an interview with Underwood on a wide spectrum of cutting-edge topics, including digital humanities, machine learning, and statistical models. When commenting on the significance of digital analysis, Underwood points out that digital analysis, with a bird's-eye view, can bring to light a broader landscape of literary history, thus drastically revolutionizing how we perceive literary history. Not only does he lay particular emphasis on the fact that data is a construction, but also he elaborates on the idea that quantitative analysis can also be critical in light of the latest progress of current digital humanities research. With regard to the future trends of digital humanities research, he declares that the problem that we need to reflect on and wrestle with at present is how to change the existing practice of data science to make it work for critique. © Copyright by Foreign Literature Studies.

Indeed, visual sequences of punctuation from different authors produce marvellously different (and visually striking) sequences. Punctuation is a largely overlooked stylistic feature in stylometry, the quantitative analysis of written text. In this paper, we examine punctuation sequences in a corpus of literary documents and ask the following questions: Are the properties of such sequences a distinctive feature of different authors? Is it possible to distinguish literary genres based on their punctuation sequences? Do the punctuation styles of authors evolve over time? Are we on to something interesting in trying to do stylometry without words, or are we full of sound and fury (signifying nothing)? In our investigation, we examine a large corpus of documents from Project Gutenberg (a digital library with many possible editorial influences). We extract punctuation sequences from each document in our corpus and record the number of words that separate punctuation marks. Using such information about punctuation-usage patterns, we attempt both author and genre recognition, and we also examine the evolution of punctuation usage over time. Our efforts at author recognition are particularly successful. Among the features that we consider, the one that seems to carry the most explanatory power is an empirical approximation of the joint probability of the successive occurrence of two punctuation marks. In our conclusions, we suggest several directions for future work, including the application of similar analyses for investigating translations and other types of categorical time series. © 2020 The Author(s).",categorical time series,computational linguistics,computational methods,digital humanities,Markov processes,mathematical modelling,natural language processing,Stylometry,Darmon A.N.M.,Bazzi M.,Howison S.D.,Porter M.A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conceptualizing an Outside World The Case of “Foreign” in Dutch Newspapers 1815-1914,0,10.3167/choc.2021.160203,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85130116702&doi=10.3167%2fchoc.2021.160203&partnerID=40&md5=6e67207727343db180ff11be7bd2ea03,"This article studies the concept of buitenland (the foreign) in a broad sample of Dutch newspapers in the period between 1815 and 1914. Buitenland emerged as a key concept in the nineteenth century. It referred to an “outside word” that was marked by semantic properties such as instability and closeness. As such, this apparently mundane spatial indicator bolstered the emergent “spatial regime” of globality and globalization. The article thus shows how a computational analysis of concepts that could be easily overlooked reveals structural transformations in the way past and present societies conceptualize (global) space. © 2021 Berghahn Journals, Ltd.

Transductive Convergence of Digital Humanities/Trans Media Art/World Literature,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128675362&partnerID=40&md5=d680a95d981cf8a456080bb3d7784b38,"The singular and constant interaction of form and matter, as well as the potential and dynamism of matter, have been overlooked in material morphology theory. Gilbert Simondon's individuation theory ingeniously identifies these blind spots and defines “individual” as the consequence of the “individuation process.” By revealing the potentials of a “pre-individual” that has not yet been individuated as a focus, Simondon demonstrates how “pre-individual forces” as the conditions of natural and technological existence contribute to the formation of “individuals” such as organisms, non-organisms, biological entities, and individual technical objects. The “pre-individual forces” exist temporally prior to the individual and possess the energy of the sustaining constitutive force by which the individual sustains and evolves itself. The pre-individual condition of being is an endless “resource of potentiality” from which being emerges from becoming, which is analogous to Heidegger’s concept of “Bestand/standing reserve” in his “Question concerning the Technology.” Once the pre-individual is conceptualized as a “metastable being” in relation to its surroundings or “associated milieu,” the individual's movement is termed as “transduction,” referring to an operation that generates itself by elaborating, concretizing, and structuring the surrounding area. Similarly to how deduction and induction seek to solve problems associated with an already-individuated context, transduction is a problem-solving ability. While elucidating transduction in terms of “feedback loops” within the “associated milieu” of humans, science, and technology, the purpose of this work is to apply transduction logic to the convergence of transmedia, world literature, and digital humanities in terms of aesthetics and ethics. © 2021 Shanghai Normal University.

Shanghai memory as a digital humanities platform to rebuild the history of the city,0,10.1093/llc/fqab023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126689751&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqab023&partnerID=40&md5=6c65511c6149a90e5ee5d5839844e209,"With the development of digital technology, Memory Projects, such as the American Memory and the Venice Time Machine, have been explored continually as typical digital humanity projects. In these projects, humanists are able to look into the thousand-year-history with a macro view by a 'data telescope', as well as numerous micro views by 'data microscopes'. This article investigates representative historical memory and city memory projects from over the past 20 years and analyses the purpose, investigation, cooperation, methods, implementation, and technical routes adopted. The following problems are apparent: resource decentralization and fragmentation, duplication of database construction, single-user service mode and low utilization rate of cultural heritage resources, etc. This study provides an overall technical route to solve these problems by examining ongoing practice. The Shanghai Memory Project, undertaken by Shanghai Library, uses knowledge reorganization and data reconciling technologies such as Big Data, Semantic Web, and Knowledge Graph to construct an overarching Humanities Research Environment, which is co-constructing, sharing, and interconnecting to avoid problems of resource decentralization and database duplication. The Project provides a user service model, which combines the library creating knowledge with user-generated content. Implementing data visualization technologies, such as AR, VR, etc., the project improves the collection display and promotes the utilization of the resources. The Urban Memory Project is a comprehensive program that relies on cooperation and interdisciplinary collaboration, co-construction, and the sharing of data. Meanwhile, an increasing number of Urban Memory Projects play a significant role in helping to develop the Digital Humanities' infrastructure. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The analysis is based on a review of DH crowdsourcing literature, as a result of which there is an indication of shortcomings of the psychological data-driven approach that has dominated thus far. The second aim of the article is to offer a new model that synthesizes the psychological-motivation approach with a sociological one. Applying Pierre Bourdieu's Theory of Capital, the motivation model created by the psychological self-determination theory (SDT) is supplemented with capital dimensions and specific types of capital. The new model is empirically tested, utilizing specific data collected in the course of a crowdsourcing project, specifically, volunteers' online survey. The conclusion states that the model synthesized using the psychological and sociological approach preserves the main SDT category scale (intrinsic-extrinsic), at the same time, the sociological capital categories implemented therein permit for making more concrete the psychological scale's 'intermediate phase' (internalized extrinsic motivations) that had been amorphous up to that point, rendering the motivation model more coherent and readily applied. © 2021 The Author(s).

Locke (University of Houston-Victoria) and Ben Wright (University of Texas at Dallas). Given that Locke and Wright argued for the coexistence of transparency alongside formal academic peer review, subjecting their submission to an open review made sense. The peer review process itself tested the propositions about the democratization of scholarship they put forth in their submission. Their article appears in a new section of the AHR, ""Writing History in a Digital Age,""overseen by consulting editor Lara Putnam (https://ahropenreview.com/). The maturation of digital history has propelled historians' embrace of open educational resources. But, this article argues, open access licensing is not enough. Digital history's earliest practitioners promised not just more accessible digital materials, but a broader democratization of history itself. This article therefore moves beyond questions of technological innovation and digital access in the rise of digital history to engage more fundamental and intractable questions about inequality, community, and participatory historical inquiry. © 2021 Oxford University Press.

Based on the aggregation of digital sources of Siberian origin, the ProSiberia project aims to create a research platform that will bring together scholars, content curators (libraries, museums, archives) and society in order to study Siberia and position the region in the global information space. Work on the platform began in 2020 within the framework of the Program for Increasing the Competitiveness of National Research Tomsk State Unversity by the staff of the Tomsk State University Research Library. Now the platform has implemented opportunities both for humanitarian researchers and for civic science representatives (volunteers). For researchers, access to digital copies of texts about Siberia with detailed description and full-text search is organized; it is possible to create one's own collections of texts; there are some text collaboration tools. It is also possible to find researchers with similar interests and exchange views. A volunteer can edit texts, operate a blog, participate in challenges. The platform is also being filled with new texts. Prospects for the development of the project are considered; they were formulated based on the results of surveys and focus groups. The main directions of development include: work on improving the quality of texts (attracting volunteers for their correct recognition); aggregation of digital tools for the humanities in one place for effective work with texts; attraction of partners; integration into the educational process. The most difficult issue is the aggregation of digital tools. The article lists their most interesting groups: tools for creating and working with digital facsimiles, textometric tools, and a number of tools for working with digitized manuscripts. Thus, at the moment, the initial version of the ProSiberia platform has been created. It allows implementing remotely the basic functions characteristic for any research in the field of humanities. However, most probably, the most important and difficult will be the next stage of the work, which includes, among other things, the aggregation of digital tools for working with the text of interest for the researcher. Therefore, it is extremely important to have a broad discussion in the professional community of both the work already done within the ProSiberia project and the further prospects for its development. © 2021 Tomsk State University - Faculty of Philology.

However, media coverage remains generally quite superficial and the topic is often approached from the viewpoint of the 'accuracy' of the information. In this article, I would like to highlight the discursive dimension, which I believe to be crucial when looking at Fake News. I will therefore seek to approach this issue not from a true/false perspective, but rather by considering the processes of turning information into discourse, of handling and constructing social reality or referents. To this end, I shall first outline the contribution that the digital humanities can make to the analysis of meaning in corpora, and the way in which they can provide a means to objectively access interpretative processes within the information conveyed. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

By combining Snapchat and StoryMap in the second language (L2) literature classroom, students adapt L2 language skills to twenty-first-century modes of communication, collaborate with peers, and creatively cross-disciplinary boundaries. Essential to this approach is the consideration of Snapchat (and image-based social media apps) as a twenty-first century literary genre (Bender 2020), and of mobile apps as interdisciplinary research objects (Morris and Murray 2018). From this point of departure, this essay offers a case study of a “medium-inflected DHL2” approach (Cro 2020) to a Spanish literature seminar. It demonstrates how non-traditional, DH-inflected assignments increase student engagement with literature by fostering creativity and productive language play in communicative and analytic contexts. At the curricular level, literature professors’ essential role in second-language acquisition becomes visible and active, as DH tools bridge the “language/literature split” (Bernhardt 2001) in L2 pedagogy and curriculum design in higher education. A creative DHL2 approach that adopts an alternative view of traditional L2 literature content to generate non-traditional assessments will improve L2 literature pedagogy and make literary content relevant to students’ personal and professional experiences.

With these limitations in mind, in this paper I consider what it means to implement digital humanities approaches into graduate research in the variety of Modern Language departments that exist in the United States. More specifically, I address both the inherent risks and the potential rewards of such interventions. As a way of concluding, I discuss the unique affordances that emerge from encouraging the study of the digital humanities in Modern Language departments.

Historical maps should be managed following a semantic approach that considers data models and standards from the different disciplines of cultural heritage and Digital humanities. In this spirit, this research extends previous efforts to implement an application profile for documenting historical maps based on the CIDOC model and to develop an annotated database of historical maps.

Many digital humanities projects tend to model their data based on CIDOC-CRM ontology, which offers a wide array of classes appropriate for storing humanities and cultural heritage data. The CIDOC-CRM ontology model leads to a knowledge graph structure in which many entities are often linked to each other through chains of relations, which means that relevant information often lies many hops away from their entities. In this paper, we present a method based on graph walks and text processing to extract entity information and provide semantically relevant embeddings. In the process, we were able to generate similarity recommenda-tions as well as explore their underlying data structure.

Are logical methods still dominant today, or have the types of formal methods used in philosophy changed in recent times? To address this question, we coded a sample of philosophy papers from the late 2000s and from the late 2010s for the formal methods they used. The results indicate that (a) the proportion of papers using logical methods remained more or less constant over that time period but (b) the proportion of papers using probabilistic methods was approximately three times higher in the late 2010s than it was in the late 2000s. Further analyses explored this change by looking more closely at specific methods, specific levels of technical engagement, and specific subdisciplines within philosophy. These analyses indicate that the increasing proportion of papers using probabilistic methods was pervasive, not confined to particular probabilistic methods, levels of sophistication, or subdisciplines. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Digital humanities,Formal methods in philosophy,Logic,Metaphilosophy,Philosophical Studies,Probability,,,Fletcher S.C.,Knobe J.,Wheeler G.,Woodcock B.A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such representation is almost always of mainstream history and usually presented from a Western perspective. Set in a fictitious Himalayan kingdom in South Asia, Ubisoft’s Far Cry 4 is arguably a crucial example of how history is represented using Western and even colonial frameworks and where the narratives that do not emerge from conventional written history are almost always rendered invisible. Using the frameworks of Subaltern Studies and “border-thinking,” this essay attempts to unpack issues of Orientalism and “colonial difference”; it then engages with postcolonial digital humanities and postcolonial game studies to comment on how history is represented in videogames and how the neglected gaps and silences in the game are important in constructing the historiography in videogames. In the process, the essay engages in a debate with current notions of videogame-historiography. © The Author(s) 2021.",border-thinking,minor history,postcolonial,South Asia,subaltern pasts,,,,Mukherjee S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Anti-Asian Sentiments during the COVID-19 Pandemic across 20 Countries: Analysis of a 12-Billion-Word News Media Database,7,10.2196/28305,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118681046&doi=10.2196%2f28305&partnerID=40&md5=3d55710d817fd8b83e46963e8584e7e3,"Background: US president Joe Biden signed an executive action directing federal agencies to combat hate crimes and racism against Asians, which have percolated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is one of the first known empirical studies to dynamically test whether global societal sentiments toward Asians have become more negative during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study aimed to investigate whether global societal sentiments toward Asians across 20 countries have become more negative, month by month, from before the pandemic (October 2019) to May 2020, along with the pandemic (incidence and mortality rates) and cultural (Hofstede's cultural dimensions) predictors of this trend. Methods: We leveraged a 12-billion-word web-based media database, with over 30 million newspaper and magazine articles taken from over 7000 sites across 20 countries, and identified 6 synonyms of ""Asian"" that are related to the coronavirus. We compiled their most frequently used descriptors (collocates) from October 2019 to May 2020 across 20 countries, culminating in 85,827 collocates that were rated by 2 independent researchers to provide a Cumulative Asian Sentiment Score (CASS) per month. This allowed us to track significant shifts in societal sentiments toward Asians from a baseline period (October to December 2019) to the onset of the pandemic (January to May 2020). We tested the competing predictors of this trend: Pandemic variables of incidence and mortality rates measured monthly for all 20 countries taken from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, and Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions of Individualism, Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance, and Masculinity for the 20 countries. Results: Before the pandemic in December 2019, Jamaica and New Zealand evidenced the most negative societal sentiments toward Asians; when news about the coronavirus was released in January 2020, the United States and Nigeria evidenced the most negative sentiments toward Asians among 20 countries. Globally, sentiments of Asians became more negative-a significant linear decline during the COVID-19 pandemic. CASS trended neutral before the pandemic during the baseline period of October to November 2019 and then plummeted in February 2020. CASS were, ironically, not predicted by COVID-19's incidence and mortality rates, but rather by Hofstede's cultural dimensions: Individualism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance-as shown by mixed models (N=28,494). Specifically, higher power distance, individualism, and uncertainty avoidance were associated with negative societal sentiments toward Asians. Conclusions: Racism, in the form of Anti-Asian sentiments, are deep-seated, and predicated on structural undercurrents of culture. The COVID-19 pandemic may have indirectly and inadvertently exacerbated societal tendencies for racism. Our study lays the important groundwork to design interventions and policy communications to ameliorate Anti-Asian racism, which are culturally nuanced and contextually appropriate. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The crystal goblet revisited: Approaching text as documentation within the digital humanities,1,10.1093/llc/fqab006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117548316&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqab006&partnerID=40&md5=747556c1ecfecfc8a3a65653b4eed8d6,"Within the digital humanities, text is often privileged. The core concern of digital humanities research and studies tends to focus on text and textual analyses. The materiality of text is often overlooked. Text, however, does not exist outside of the physical support instantiating it. The materiality of digital text should be foregrounded within the digital humanities to illuminate its fundamental role in transforming text into diverse physical instantiations that are used for diverse purposes, needs, and tasks. This article therefore calls for greater documentary analyses of text, with a specific emphasis on exploring the documentation of digital text. Revisiting and employing Beatrice Warde's metaphor of the crystal goblet as a framing device to structure its discussion, this article argues that documentation is necessary for the materialization of text into material instantiations that can be interacted with, engaged, and used. Documentation, further, determines the kinds, forms, and formats of text that can be inscribed into or displayed on a specific medium that, in turn, shapes the affordances of and practices with that text, including reading, writing, annotating, commenting, viewing, and/or hearing. Authors and creators of text write or construct texts to become instantiated into/as material objects, from manuscripts, books, and e-books, to film and music, to databases, websites, and computer files. By drawing attention to the importance of documentation and its associated affordances and practices, the object status of digital texts is foregrounded by documentary analyses. Foregrounding documentation within the digital humanities is further necessary as digital technologies continue to alter the ways in which text is documented; that is, the way text is created, deployed, and used. Digital text is not ephemeral data points floating in the virtual either but instantiated in and as digital documents. This article presents a tripartite model of digital documentation to uncloak the complex material constitution of digital documents and, thus, digital text. This model helps demonstrate the extent to which digital text exists in and as digital documents. The virtual world of the digital humanities, and its respective texts and documentation, is indeed a material world. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EADH.

Specifically, we have designed a linguistic index that measures the marked usage of gendered modifiers in the Chinese language; this predicts the degree of occupational gender segregation by identifying the unbalanced distribution of males and females across occupations. The effectiveness of the linguistic index in modelling occupational gender segregation was confirmed through survey responses from 244 participants, covering 63 occupations listed in the Holland Occupational Codes. The index was then applied to explore the trends and variations of gender equality in occupation, drawing on an extensive digital collection of materials published by the largest newspaper group in China for both longitudinal (from 1946 to 2018) and synchronic (from 31 provincial-level administrative divisions) data. This quantitative study shows that (1) the use of gendered language has weakened over time, indicating a decline in occupational gender stereotyping; (2) conservative genres have shown higher degrees of gendered language use; (3) culturally conservative, demographically stable, or geographically remote regions have higher degrees of gendered language use. These findings are discussed with consideration of historical, cultural, social, psychological, and geographical factors. While the existing literature on gendered language has been an important and useful tool for reading a text in the context of digital humanities, an innovative textual analytics approach, as shown in this paper, can prove to be a crucial indicator of historical trends and variations in social development. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,Su Q.,Liu P.,Wei W.,Zhu S.,Huang C.-R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If people want to know the different types of art that exist, how individual works are connected, and how works of art are interpreted and discussed in the context of other works, they must utilize means other than simply viewing the art. Therefore, this paper proposes a language to analyze, describe, and explore collections of visual art (LadeCA). LadeCA combines human interpretation and automatic analyses of images, allowing users to assess collections of visual art without viewing every image in them. This paper focuses on the lexical base of LadeCA. It also outlines how collections of visual art can be analyzed, described, and explored using a LadeCA vocabulary. Additionally, the relationship between LadeCA and indexing systems, such as ICONCLASS or AAT, is demonstrated, and ways in which LadeCA and indexing systems can complement each other are highlighted.

However, collapsing the texts’ rich stories into a single number is often conceptually perilous, and it is difficult to confidently interpret interesting or unexpected textual patterns without looming concerns about data artifacts or measurement validity. To better capture fine-grained differences between texts, we introduce generalized word shift graphs, visualizations which yield a meaningful and interpretable summary of how individual words contribute to the variation between two texts for any measure that can be formulated as a weighted average. We show that this framework naturally encompasses many of the most commonly used approaches for comparing texts, including relative frequencies, dictionary scores, and entropy-based measures like the Kullback–Leibler and Jensen–Shannon divergences. Through a diverse set of case studies ranging from presidential speeches to tweets posted in urban green spaces, we demonstrate how generalized word shift graphs can be flexibly applied across domains for diagnostic investigation, hypothesis generation, and substantive interpretation.

The problem is well-known to be computationally hard as soon as the number of input strings is not bounded. Due to its practical importance, a huge number of heuristics have been devised, which have proved very successful in a wide range of applications. Alignments nevertheless have received hardly any attention as formal, mathematical structures. Here, we focus on the compositional aspects of alignments, which underlie most algorithmic approaches to computing alignments. We also show that the concepts naturally generalize to finite partially ordered sets and partial maps between them that in some sense preserve the partial orders. As a consequence of this discussion we observe that alignments of even more general structure, in particular graphs, are essentially characterized by the fact that the restriction of alignments to a row must coincide with the corresponding input graphs. Pairwise alignments of graphs are therefore determined completely by common induced subgraphs. In this setting alignments of alignments are well-defined, and alignments can be decomposed recursively into subalignments. This provides a general framework within which different classes of alignment algorithms can be explored for objects very different from sequences and other totally ordered data structures. © 2020, The Author(s).",Multiple sequence alignment,Partial order,Projection,Subgraph isomorphism,Tree alignment,,,,Berkemer S.J.,Höner zu Siederdissen C.,Stadler P.F.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigate contemporary philosophy of science by means of computational text-mining approaches: we apply topic-modeling algorithms to eight major philosophy of science journals, from the 1930s up until 2017.

In this article, I argue that the use of numerical representation and data analysis methods offers a new language for describing cultural artifacts, experiences and dynamics. The human languages such as English or Russian that developed rather recently in human evolution are not good at capturing analog properties of human sensorial and cultural experiences. These limitations become particularly worrying if we want to compare thousands, millions or billions of artifacts—i.e. to study contemporary media and cultures at their new twenty-first century scale. When we instead use numerical measurements of image properties standard in Computer Vision, we can better capture details of a single artifact as well as visual differences between a number of artifacts–even if they are very small. The examples of visual dimensions that numbers can capture better then languages include color, shape, texture, contours, composition, and visual characteristics of represented faces, bodies and objects. The methods of finding structures and relationships in large numerical datasets developed in statistics and machine learning allow us to extend this analysis to very big datasets of cultural objects. Equally importantly, numerical image features used in Computer Vision also give us a new language to represent gradual and continuous temporal changes—something which natural languages are also bad at. This applies to both single artworks such as a film or a dance piece (describing movement and rhythm) and also to changes in visual characteristics in millions of artifacts over decades or centuries. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Computer vision,Cultural analytics,Digital humanities,Language of art,,,,,Manovich L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New methods are required to read, understand and work with the data, resulting in computation becoming increasingly central to both creation of a cultural reality and as the interpretative tool and practice. If artists’ look, then how might a machine see as a critical tool? Developing work on computational culture and the Next Rembrandt project as unstable digital object, this paper considers how the medium affects computational critical practice. Drawing on Heidegger’s view of causality and Derrida’s grammatology, this paper explores how the medium acts a locus between the human and machine readings and the remediations that occur within the reading.

[Methods] First, we constructed an Ancient-modern Chinese alignment corpus at sentence level. Then, we used the word alignment algorithm to process the corpus. Finally, we extracted the synonyms based on the word alignments. [Results] The proposed method could automatically extract ancient Chinese synonyms. It successfully generated 16, 272 sets of synonyms with an accuracy rate of 40.12%. [Limitations] This method does not work with the corpus without Ancientmodern Chinese sentence level alignment. More research is needed to improve the effects of word segmentation and alignment algorithms, which will yield better extraction results. [Conclusions] The proposed method could expand the manually compiled thesaurus, and lead human computing research to the semantic level. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Given that processing methods are not standardized, this leaves questions regarding the comparability of processed and digitally curated 3D datasets. The goal of this study was to identify those processing parameters that result in the most consistent fit between CT-derived meshes and a 3D surface model of the same human mandible. Eight meshes, each using unique thresholding and smoothing parameters, were compared to assess whole-object deviations, deviations along curves, and deviations between specific anatomical features on the surface model when compared with the CT scans using a suite of comparison points. Based on calculated gap distances, the mesh that thresholded at 0 with an applied smoothing technique was found to deviate least from the surface model, although it is not the most biologically accurate. Results have implications for aggregated studies that employ multimodal 3D datasets, and caution is recommended for studies that enlist 3D data from websites and digital repositories, particularly if processing parameters are unknown or derived for studies with different research foci.

Starting from the communication sciences—journalism in particular—and digital humanities via the history of communication, we show how to use interactive digital maps for the production and publication of knowledge through and/or for participation. Firstly, we establish the theoretical-conceptual framework necessary to base the practices, dividing the elements into three areas: interactive maps and knowledge production (decentralization, pluralization, reticularization, and humanization), maps as instruments to promote political and social participation (egalitarianism, horizontality, and criticism), and maps as instruments for the visualization of data that favors the user experience (interactivity, multimediality, reticularity of reading, and participation). Next, we present two cases that we developed to put into practice the theoretical concepts that we established: the Mapa Infoparticipa (Infoparticipa Map), which shows the results of the evaluation of the transparency of public administrations, and the Ciutadania Plural (Plural Citizenship) web platform for the production of social knowledge about the past and the present. This theoretical and practical model shows the possibilities of interactive maps as tools to promote political participation and as instruments for the construction of social knowledge in a collaborative, participatory, networked way. © 2021 by the authors.

Evaluating a taxonomy of textual uncertainty for collaborative visualisation in the digital humanities,0,10.3390/info12110436,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85118888353&doi=10.3390%2finfo12110436&partnerID=40&md5=9d8892954a88cce5fe68a529aea95b68,"The capture, modelling and visualisation of uncertainty has become a hot topic in many areas of science, such as the digital humanities (DH). Fuelled by critical voices among the DH community, DH scholars are becoming more aware of the intrinsic advantages that incorporating the notion of uncertainty into their workflows may bring. Additionally, the increasing availability of ubiquitous, web-based technologies has given rise to many collaborative tools that aim to support DH scholars in performing remote work alongside distant peers from other parts of the world. In this context, this paper describes two user studies seeking to evaluate a taxonomy of textual uncertainty aimed at enabling remote collaborations on digital humanities (DH) research objects in a digital medium. Our study focuses on the task of free annotation of uncertainty in texts in two different scenarios, seeking to establish the requirements of the underlying data and uncertainty models that would be needed to implement a hypothetical collaborative annotation system (CAS) that uses information visualisation and visual analytics techniques to leverage the cognitive effort implied by these tasks. To identify user needs and other requirements, we held two user-driven design experiences with DH experts and lay users, focusing on the annotation of uncertainty in historical recipes and literary texts. The lessons learned from these experiments are gathered in a series of insights and observations on how these different user groups collaborated to adapt an uncertainty taxonomy to solve the proposed exercises. Furthermore, we extract a series of recommendations and future lines of work that we share with the community in an attempt to establish a common agenda of DH research that focuses on collaboration around the idea of uncertainty. © 2021 by the authors.

Newspapers are an integral source of current information that are syndicated and amplified by social media to a wide global audience. This is one of the first known studies to operationalize news media diversity and examine its association with cultural values during the pandemic. We tracked the global diversity of COVID‐19 coverage in a news media database of 12 billion words, collated from 28 million articles over 7000 news websites, across 8 months. Media diversity was measured weekly by the number of unique descriptors of 10 target terms of the pandemic (e.g., COVID‐19, coronavirus) and normalized by the corpus size for the respective countries per week. Government Stringency was taken from the Oxford COVID‐19 Government Response Tracker and cultural scores were taken from Hofstede’s Cultural Values global database. Results showed that Media Diversity Rate increased 6.7 times over 8 months, from the baseline period (October–December 2019) to during the pandemic (January–May 2020). Mixed effects modelling revealed that higher COVID‐19 prevalence rates and governmental stringency predicted this increase. Interestingly, collectivist cultures are linked to more diverse media coverage during COVID‐19. It is possible that news outlets in collectivist societies are motivated to present a diverse array of topics given the impact of COVID‐19 on every segment of society. Of broader significance, we provided a framework to design targeted public health communications that are culturally nuanced. © 2021 by the authors.

Societal narratives on caregivers in Asia,7,10.3390/ijerph182111241,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117905247&doi=10.3390%2fijerph182111241&partnerID=40&md5=6f25b3dac083b303fd6de8445603f235,"Although there has been an increase in awareness of the struggles experienced by caregivers, discourse on caregiving remains confined mostly to academia, policy circles or the family unit. There have been suggestions that public discourse on informal caregiving dwells overwhelmingly on the outsize toll it takes on the health of caregivers. However, few studies have examined societal narratives on caregivers—a gap our study aims to fill. We leveraged an online media database of 12 billion words collated from over 30 million articles to explore societal narratives on caregivers in six Asian countries. Computational linguistics and statistical analysis were applied to study the content of narratives on caregivers. The prevalence of societal narratives on caregivers was highest in Singapore—five times higher than Sri Lanka, which evidenced the lowest prevalence. Findings reveal that the inadequacies of institutional care as well as the need to train and empower caregivers are pressing issues that need to be prioritized on the policy agenda in Asia. Of broader significance, the diverse capabilities across Asia present opportunities for cross-country learning and capacity-building. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose that creating texts or 'texting' is a form of joint action. We examine the nature and evolution of this joint action. We argue that creating texts ushers in a special type of joint action, which, while lacking some central features of normal, everyday joint actions such as spatio-temporal collocation of agency and embodiment, nonetheless results in an authentic, strong, and unique type of joint action agency. This special type of agency is already present in creating texts in general and is further augmented in creating texts through digital media. We propose that such a unique type of joint action agency has a transformative effect on the experience of our sense of agency and subjectivity. We conclude with the implications of the proposal for social cognition and social agency.

He served as Chair of Judges for the National Book Award for Fiction in 2016. His book, The Economy of Prestige (Harvard UP), a study of the history, functions, and effects of prizes in literature and arts, was named Best Academic Book of 2005 by New York Magazine. His economic theory of cultural prestige has exerted extensive influence in the fields of literary theory, cultural sociology and cultural economics. On behalf of Foreign Literature Studies, Rui Xiaohe, a Fulbright visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania (2019-2020), interviewed English in January 2020 on issues of interdisciplinary studies of literature and economics, the development of theories of literary economics after Bourdieu and Jameson, and the application of Digital Humanities as well as other methods. English points out that interdisciplinary studies of literature and economics should center on the system of production of literary value. Intersecting with economics and sociology, literary studies should focus on non-monetary dimensions of literary economics, which involve cultural prestige and social capital in the context of the whole social field, where literary value is produced.

On the other hand, ample research projects and studies have been published that demonstrate the great capabilities of web-geographic information systems (web-GIS) for the dissemination and online representation of cultural heritage data. However, cultural heritage data and the associated metadata produced by many cultural heritage institutions are hetero-geneous. To make this heterogeneous data more interoperable and structured, an ever-growing number of cultural heritage institutions are adopting linked data principles. Although the cultural heritage domain has already started implementing linked open data concepts to the cultural heritage data, there are not many research articles that present an easy-to-implement, free, and open-source-based web-GIS architecture that integrates 3D digital cultural heritage models with cloud computing and linked open data. Furthermore, the integration of web-GIS technologies with 3D web-based visualisation and linked open data may offer new dimensions of interaction and exploration of digital cultural heritage. To demonstrate the high potential of integration of these technol-ogies, this study presents a novel cloud architecture that attempts to enhance digital cultural heritage exploration by integrating 3D digital cultural heritage models with linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms using web-GIS technologies. More specifically, a digital interactive map, 3D digital cultural heritage models, and linked open data from DBpedia and GeoNames platforms were integrated into a cloud-based web-GIS architecture. Thus, the users of the architecture can easily interact with the digital map, visualise 3D digital cultural heritage models, and ex-plore linked open data from GeoNames and DBpedia platforms, which offer additional information and context related to the selected cultural heritage site as well as external web resources. The architecture was validated by applying it to specific case studies of Australian cultural heritage and seeking expert feedback on the system, its benefits, and scope for improvement in the near future. © 2021 by the authors.

Phraseological motifs for Distinguishing Between Literary Genres.

First steps towards checking the validity of this hypothesis had been undertaken in pioneering works in the 1990s/2000s (e.g. Stubbs & Barth 2003). These studies were however limited by the small size of their (exclusively English) corpora. The present study explores the role of some patterns (phraseological motifs) in distinguishing French literary subgenres. It also proposes a case study of some motifs related to the verbal (dire avec sourire ‘to say with a smile’) and non-verbal communication (adresser un sourire ‘to send a smile’). Un-like traditional corpus-stylistic analyses, which frequently focus on the style of a single author, our corpus-driven approach identifies lexico-syntactic constructions in literary genres which are automatically extracted from the corpora. The main purpose is to show the relevance of the notion of phraseological motif (Le-gallois 2012; Longrée & Mellet 2013; Novakova & Siepmann 2020) for the distinction of literary subgenres. Linking form and meaning, these ‘multidimensional units’ fulfil pragmatic as well as discursive functions. The data has been extracted from large French corpora of the PhraseoRom research pro-ject https://phraseorom.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr. They are accessible on http://phraseotext. univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/phraseobase/index.html and contain 1000 novels (published from the 1950s to the present), partitioned into six sub-corpora: general literature (GEN), crime fiction (CRIM), romances (ROM), historical novels (HIST), science fiction (SF) and fantasy (FY). The results of our study reveal some unexpected differences between the literary subgen-res: e.g. the motif dire d’une voix ‘to say in a voice’ in HIST compared to GEN. In FY, expressions of verbal communication are related to shouting and screaming. Expressions related to the non-verbal communication (prendre dans ses bras ‘to take in one’s arms’) are specific to ROM, where body language is overrepresented. In SF, there is a very limited number of these types of expressions. More generally, the motifs provide the link between the micro level (phraseological recurrences) and the macro level (the fictional script). © 2021 Iva Novakova.

In this paper we retrace, from an editorial perspective, the experimentation of computational text analysis techniques – in this case topic modeling and sentiment analysis – on a corpus of archival documents, the correspondence between Ignazio Silone and Arnoldo Mondadori Editore (396 pieces of correspondence). The results that emerged, even with the limitations documented in the article, allow us to hypothesize how these tools, outside of literary criticism strictu sensu, can also play a role in the study and, above all, in the edition of author’s letters, and how their output, integrated with methodologies and techniques of digital scholarly editing, can make the experience more productive for readers. © 2021, University of Bologna Department of Classical and Italian Philology, Alma Mater Studiorum.

Poetry in action: Networks of literary communication and the cultural leverage in the eighteenth-century Seoul,0,10.1093/llc/fqaa018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85133488468&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqaa018&partnerID=40&md5=880e1bf2562cae1796ce0e355735e9ff,"This article revisits the study of the poetry communities, sisa, in the eighteenth-century Seoul, in terms of their membership, structural patterns, and boundaries of interaction. By applying methods in the digital humanities such as social network analysis and geographical information systems, I argue that literary activities in the sisa were performed beyond the factional demarcations, and cultural leverage was determined by their positional advantage in the community structure, not imposed by the political dominance. The factional affiliations of the participants were not directly correlated with the formation of cultural identities. The poetry communities functioned as major loci of cultural textual networks in the late Chosǒn Seoul. Paying no heed to hierarchical distinction, the participants enjoyed the convivial spontaneous environments and shared their literary works with one another. Focusing on the collaborative nature of the era, many modern scholars have examined the kinship, social classes, and political orientations of the community members; furthermore, some argue that those who belonged to influential political factions also exercised their cultural influence and set mainstream literary trends. My research differs from previous contributions in its emphasis on the relational community structure and the information flow. Measuring the homogeneity, centralities, and membership, I prove that the cultural practices were much more complicated beyond the social-political system, and explain how politically marginalized people were able to gain leverage in the cultural world. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Relevant evidence is available, but it is principally contained in disparate historical sources. In this article, we demonstrate how such sources can be efficiently collated and analysed through the implementation of state-of-the-art computational-linguistic and historical-geographic information systems (GIS) techniques. We do so through a case study that focuses on the floristic history of the English Lake District. This region has been selected because of its outstanding cultural and environmental value and because it has been extensively and continuously documented since the late-17th century. We outline how natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be integrated with Kew's Plants of the World Online database to enable temporal shifts in plant-naming conventions to be more accurately traced across a heterogeneous corpus of texts published between 1682 and 1904. Through collocate analysis and automated geoparsing techniques, the geographies associated with these plant names are then identified and extracted. Finally, we use GIS to demonstrate the potential of this data set for geo-temporal analysis and for revealing the historical distribution of Lake District flora. In outlining our methodology, this article indicates how the spatial and digital humanities can benefit research both in environmental history and in the environmental sciences more widely. © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

A challenging yet realistic scenario is cross-domain attribution where texts of known authorship (training set) differ from texts of disputed authorship (test set) in, for example, topic or genre. In this paper, we propose the use of transfer learning based on pre-trained neural network language models and a multi-headed classifier. A series of experiments is reported to compare the effectiveness of our approach on cross-topic, cross-genre, and cross-fandom conditions with state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the crucial effect of the normalization corpus (an unlabeled corpus used to adjust the output of our classifier) in cross-domain attribution and the usefulness of shallower layers of pre-trained models. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Authorship attribution,Neural network language models,Pre-trained language models,Transfer learning,,,,,Barlas G.,Stamatatos E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We elucidate their theoretical bases and limitations while assuming a pragmatic positioning between a defense of the historical-scientific study of religion and the promotion of groundbreaking methodological outlooks emerging from the Digital Humanities. From this background, throughout the text, we argue for a complementation of historiographical “close reading” with both “distant reading” techniques and interdisciplinary research, using computer-based methods and a diversity of formal modeling techniques. In short, we conclude that such methods offer novel ways for data representation and are best understood not only as creative schemes for solving issues in historiography, but also as a springboard for new inquiries arising from the transdisciplinarity between the Humanities and the Natural Sciences.

The bidirectional character of biography leads us to the problem’s methodological level: social predicament of the individual world and reciprocal determinability of the social world by the individual world. The biographical method is closely linked to thematization of subjectivity. The biographical method’s methodological problems are connected with context, reference, authenticity, and reflexivity. The authors link the biographical method with memory studies and emphasize that the turn to memory is associated with many theoretical questions and controversies related to the status of history as a science and its relation to the field of human memory. The multidirectional biography studies reveal the lack of a conceptual apparatus, common for the interdisciplinary space of humanities, which allows to develop the criteria for comparability of scientific research results. The authors associate the further development of the biographical method with the development of the modern information society. They note the prospects of using the methods of digital humanities associated with the search, selection and analysis of texts presented in digital form. The rationale for this thesis is that at present there is a constant increase of electronic texts that can be used both for the development of the biographical method and serve as its empirical base. The article demonstrates the possibility of applying the biographical method using the tools of digital humanities on the examples of research on the history of science, which are part of the world’s cultural heritage. © St. Petersburg State University, 2021",Biographical method,Biography,Cultural memory,Digital humanities,F.

Yet, critical theory has framed cultural heritage not only as the material remains of the past, but also as a dynamic interaction of humans with their past that en-compasses tangible and intangible entities. Thus, it is necessary to research these dynamics to understand the role of cultural heritage as a resource for sustainable development. In this context, the main research question of this article is: “How does heritage is shaped and managed by the ‘pre-sent’? Can we understand this process through the opportunities of digital humanities?”. To con-front this question, the research adapts the counter-mapping methodology with the digital humanities perspective focusing on the urban protest movements that took place in the historic areas of Istanbul throughout the 1960s. It is seen that the spatial pattern of these movements was the result of the urban operations of the 1950s. In the 1950s, an autocratic government shaped the urban space and redefined the urban heritage to concentrate more power. However, in the 1960s, workers and students used the very same spaces and again redefined the urban heritage by exercising their social rights. Based on these results, the main conclusion is that for revealing the full potential of cultural heritage in sustainable development, it is necessary to deepen our knowledge on how heritage op-erates in a society, considering that heritage changes meaning depending on the socio-political context of the period. © 2021 by the authors.

From this preliminary survey, the article suggests that there was a strong enough overlap between elite reading of novels, travel literature, and history to suggest that Britain and English-speaking North America shared a common reading culture with much of Western Europe.

A Benchmark Dataset for Repetitive Pattern Recognition on Textured 3D Surfaces,2,10.1111/cgf.14352,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85113239937&doi=10.1111%2fcgf.14352&partnerID=40&md5=c7c03e8da21e8b0706c46d1b95dc1e61,"In digital archaeology, a large research area is concerned with the computer-aided analysis of 3D captured ancient pottery objects. A key aspect thereby is the analysis of motifs and patterns that were painted on these objects' surfaces. In particular, the automatic identification and segmentation of repetitive patterns is an important task serving different applications such as documentation, analysis and retrieval. Such patterns typically contain distinctive geometric features and often appear in repetitive ornaments or friezes, thus exhibiting a significant amount of symmetry and structure. At the same time, they can occur at varying sizes, orientations and irregular placements, posing a particular challenge for the detection of similarities. A key prerequisite to develop and evaluate new detection approaches for such repetitive patterns is the availability of an expressive dataset of 3D models, defining ground truth sets of similar patterns occurring on their surfaces. Unfortunately, such a dataset has not been available so far for this particular problem. We present an annotated dataset of 82 different 3D models of painted ancient Peruvian vessels, exhibiting different levels of repetitiveness in their surface patterns. To serve the evaluation of detection techniques of similar patterns, our dataset was labeled by archaeologists who identified clearly definable pattern classes. Those given, we manually annotated their respective occurrences on the mesh surfaces. Along with the data, we introduce an evaluation benchmark that can rank different recognition techniques for repetitive patterns based on the mean average precision of correctly segmented 3D mesh faces. An evaluation of different incremental sampling-based detection approaches, as well as a domain specific technique, demonstrates the applicability of our benchmark. With this benchmark we especially want to address the geometry processing community, and expect it will induce novel approaches for pattern analysis based on geometric reasoning like 2D shape and symmetry analysis. This can enable novel research approaches in the Digital Humanities and related fields, based on digitized 3D Cultural Heritage artifacts. Alongside the source code for our evaluation scripts we provide our annotation tools for the public to extend the benchmark and further increase its variety. © 2021 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2021 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

However, there is not always enough data for training, especially when it comes to historical collections of cultural heritage where the original artworks have been destroyed or damaged over time. Transfer Learning and domain adaptation techniques are possible solutions to tackle the issue of data scarcity. This article presents a new method for domain adaptation based on Knowledge graph embeddings. Knowledge Graph embedding forms a projection of a knowledge graph into a lower-dimensional where entities and relations are represented into continuous vector spaces. Our method incorporates these semantic vector spaces as a key ingredient to guide the domain adaptation process. We combined knowledge graph embeddings with visual embeddings from the images and trained a neural network with the combined embeddings as anchors using an extension of Fisher’s linear discriminant. We evaluated our approach on two cultural heritage datasets of images containing medieval and renaissance musical instruments. The experimental results showed a significant increase in the baselines and state-of-the-art performance compared with other domain adaptation methods. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

The images represent concrete and abstract content and symbolise the social, economic, political, and cultural values of the society. However, an enormous amount of such values embedded in the images is left unexploited partly due to the absence of methodological and technical solutions to capture, represent, and exploit the latent information. With the emergence of new technologies and availability of cultural heritage images in digital formats, the methodology followed to semantically enrich and utilise such resources become a vital factor in supporting users need. This paper presents a methodology proposed to unearth the cultural information communicated via cultural digital images by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies (such as Computer Vision (CV) and semantic web technologies). To this end, the paper presents a methodology that enables efficient analysis and enrichment of a large collection of cultural images covering all the major phases and tasks.

This part focuses on data interpretation, which follows their collection as discussed in the first part. Whereas the analysis process collects data modeled in text units, segments, and traits, and is typically performed once, data observation and interpretation are unlimited, open to any working hypothesis, purpose and numerical treatment, including very powerful and complex, machine-learning driven techniques. Once the metric database has been filled with data, users can make any number and type of observations on each analyzed verse, each being defined in an independent and composable software module, the observer. The observations data models and their types provide a concrete example of the quality and quantity of data added to the database at this stage, covering language-independent or specific phenomena, from the lowest to the highest granularity level, for any imagined phenomenon we may want to observe. Such data are laid out in a multidimensional space, varying according to the phenomenon being handled. Once stored, these data can be variously aggregated, either inside and outside the database, and exported for numeric processing using standard data-science tools and techniques.

We particularly focus on the synalephe, addressed in terms of the ""propensity""of a word to take part in a synalephe with adjacent words. We jointly provide an online vocabulary containing, for each word, information about its syllabification, the location of the tonic accent, and the aforementioned synalephe propensity, on the left and right sides. The algorithm is intrinsically nondeterministic, producing different possible syllabifications for each verse, with different likelihoods; metric constraints relative to accents on the 10th, 4th, and 6th syllables are used to further reduce the solution space. The most likely syllabification is hence returned as output. We believe that this work could be a major milestone for a lot of different investigations. From the point of view of digital humanities it opens new perspectives on computer-assisted analysis of digital sources, comprising automated detection of anomalous and problematic cases, metric clustering of verses and their categorization, or more foundational investigations addressing, e.g., the phonetic roles of consonants and vowels. From the point of view of text processing and deep learning, information about syllabification and the location of accents opens a wide range of exciting perspectives, from the possibility of automatic learning syllabification of words and verses to the improvement of generative models, aware of metric issues, and more respectful of the expected musicality. © 2021 ACM.",Dante Alighieri,Divina Commedia,Divine comedy,hendecasyllable,syllabification,Synalephe,,,Asperti A.,Bianco S.D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Configuration to conviction: Network structures of political judiciary in the Austrian Corporate State,0,10.1016/j.socnet.2021.03.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85103279158&doi=10.1016%2fj.socnet.2021.03.001&partnerID=40&md5=a556b8b217ebda2618e3015180d036e2,"In this paper, we analyze the extent of political judiciary in the transformed system of the Corporate State of Austria using the computational methods of a network approach. We investigate the differences in the legal prosecution of the political opposition, namely of members of the Communist, Social Democratic and National Socialist parties based on Vienna as a case study. Based on over 1,800 court records from 1935 processed at the Viennese provincial courts, we evaluate the courts’ practice in contrast to the official legislature during the consolidated phase of the regime. In this study, we examine whether the law was strategically utilized against specific groups (following the concept of Kirchheimer (1965)’s political lawsuit), and as in the more lenient version of Fraenkel (1927/1968)’s tendency justice, we analyze whether the law was disadvantageously interpreted for political partisanship up to a blatant breach of conduct. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods with network science approaches, we identify patterns of political prosecution and structural predispositions for the sentencing of left- and right-wing groups of the political opposition. We can prove different practices of political judiciary and differentiate between the different treatment of Social Democrats, Communists and National Socialists in 1935 in Vienna. We identify specialized strategies to prosecute the political opposition, resulting in a clear bias against left-wing groups and a relative leniency in the conviction of National Socialists based on the evolution of charges in the courts’ actions. Using a multimodal network approach, we reveal key players and cooperation of judges and prosecutors which accounted for harsher sentences. We provide evidence that the system of control over the judiciary and over the political opposition was already crumbling in the Austrian capital in 1935, even before the “Anschluss” to NS-Germany in 1938. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Big historical data,Computational history,Digital humanities,Historical network research,Judicial networks,Mixed methods,Network analysis,,Petz C.,Pfeffer J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I provide a theoretical framework for studying venues for humanities work drawing on the phenomenological approach to the concepts of place and space, the pedagogical perspective on learning spaces in higher education, and epistemological studies of scientific places. Next, I analyse the landscape for the reconfiguration of humanities venues and present arguments for engaging with space by referring to the functioning of digital humanities. This essay shows that place is an extremely important resource, seeing as it is endowed with the power to drive new practices, institutionalize a community, and consolidate a discipline. Therefore, humanists should reflect critically on the ‘architecture of the humanities’ and engage in making their own spaces that determine practices, communication, and well-being. © The Author(s) 2020.",architecture of the humanities,community of practice,digital humanities,humanities space,infrastructure,laboratory,Place and space,situated knowledge production,Pawlicka-Deger U.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is a probability of belief change (PBC). This value indicates how likely agents are to change their mind in interactions. The other is the size of the agents audience: the proportion of the population the agent has access to at any given time. In all instances, the agents converge on a single belief, although the agents are arational. I argue that this generates a skeptical hypothesis: any instance of purportedly rational consensus might just as well be a case of arational belief convergence. I also consider what the model tells us about increasing the likelihood that one agent’s belief is adopted by the rest. Agents are most likely to have their beliefs adopted by the entire population when their value for PBC is low relative to the rest of the population and their audience sizes are roughly three-quarters of the largest possible audience. I further explore the consequences of dogmatists to the population; individuals who refuse to change their mind end up polarizing the population.

This paper looks at embodied examples of human-machine co-creation from the literature of the Long 18th Century (1,650–1,850), examining how older depictions of creative machines could inform and inspire modern day research. The works are analyzed from the perspective of design fiction with special focus on the embodiment of the systems and the creativity exhibited by them. We find that the chosen examples highlight the importance of recognizing the environment as a major factor in human-machine co-creative processes and that some of the works seem to precede current examples of artificial systems reaching into our everyday lives. The examples present embodied interaction in a positive, creativity-oriented way, but also highlight ethical risks of human-machine co-creativity. Modern day perceptions of artificial systems and creativity can be limited to some extent by the technologies available; fictitious examples from centuries past allow us to examine such limitations using a Design Fiction approach. We conclude by deriving four guidelines for future research from our fictional examples: 1) explore unlikely embodiments; 2) think of situations, not systems; 3) be aware of the disjunction between action and appearance; and 4) consider the system as a situated moral agent. © Copyright © 2021 Kantosalo, Falk and Jordanous.",computational creativity,creativity,design fiction,digital humanities,embodiment,human-machine co-creativity,literature,,Kantosalo A.,Falk M.,Jordanous A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BARD is a digital repository of word-roots related to gender and life stage practices from over sixty Bantu languages. We developed it to assist us in our analysis of this large corpus of data that we used to write histories of people's material and ideological inventions that cover the longue durée across multiple regions. BARD allows researchers with internet access to search for terms by entering at least three consecutive phonemes. If phonemes exist in that sequence in any of the 64 Bantu languages that BARD holds, those words and their meanings appear as results. In this article, we discuss the usefulness and complexities of Digital Humanities (DH) as research tools. We explain our methodology and research process using three reconstructed word-roots pertinent to our research on family and generations. The three word-roots we examine invite scholars to probe how to recover deep connections and linkages between people's pasts in Africa and its Diasporas, particularly in ways that move beyond histories of the slave trade and enslavement. As we developed our open-access website African Social History and Data Across Bantu Matrilineal Communities (ASH-DABMC) and our database, BARD, we gained greater insight into the meanings encoded in our data even as we faced challenges.

According to their spatial and functional hierarchical system, the formal complexity depends on the relationships and inferences between shapes. Digital technologies open today new opportunities for the cross-analysis of many cultural heritage artifacts, afar in space but close in features (typologies, styles, compositional rules), stimulating the creation of innovative scientific frameworks. The architectonic shape investigation involves different cognitive processes based on traditional and digital methods. The definition of experimental paths to study these forms and their hierarchical relations is an open topic. Combining theoretical knowledge with technological evolution is a crucial challenge today within the trending topic of the digital humanities. It moves towards a sustainable framework to merge human-driven interpretation and computer-based massive analysis within cross-disciplinary approaches by introducing sustainable paths of methodological renewal. This goal shifts the focus to analysing architectural heritage’s geometric nature, representing the core of this journal issue. How did the authors of this issue interpret this specific topic? How has morphological analysis, regarding geometry and semantics, been declined for architecture investigation and interpretation? In Architecture, shape grammars cover a primary role in defining and understanding complex objects, behaviours, and transformations, like the bricks of a wall or the words in text composition.

Their analysis using classical volume rendering is difficult because parts of such structures can bend away or hide behind occluding elements. This problem cannot be fully compensated by effective navigation alone, as structure-adapted navigation in the volume is cumbersome and only parts of the structure are visible in each view. We solve this problem by rendering a spatially transformed view of the volume so that an unobstructed visualization of the entire curved structure is obtained. As a result, simple and intuitive navigation becomes possible. The domain of the spatial transform is defined by a triangle mesh that is topologically equivalent to an open disc and that approximates the structure of interest. The rendering is based on ray-casting, in which the rays traverse the original volume. In order to carve out volumes of varying thicknesses, the lengths of the rays as well as the positions of the mesh vertices can be easily modified by interactive painting under view control. We describe a prototypical implementation and demonstrate the interactive visual inspection of complex structures from digital humanities, biology, medicine, and material sciences. The visual representation of the structure as a whole allows for easy inspection of interesting substructures in their original spatial context. Overall, we show that thin, curved structures in volumetric data can be excellently visualized using ray-casting-based volume rendering of transformed views defined by guiding surface meshes, supplemented by interactive, local modifications of ray lengths and vertex positions. © 2021 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2021 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

This cultural quantification has been typically done by studying literary production. However, a society’s value system might well be implicitly quantified based on the decisions that people took in the past and that were mediated by what they care about. It turns out that one class of these decisions is visible in ordinary settings: it is visible in street names. We studied the names of 4,932 honorific streets in the cities of Paris, Vienna, London and New York. We chose these four cities because they were important centers of cultural influence for the Western world in the 20th century. We found that street names greatly reflect the extent to which a society is gender biased, which professions are considered elite ones, and the extent to which a city is influenced by the rest of the world. This way of quantifying a society’s value system promises to inform new methodologies in Digital Humanities; makes it possible for municipalities to reflect on their past to inform their future; and informs the design of everyday’s educational tools that promote historical awareness in a playful way. © 2021 Bancilhon et al.

This article argues that fiction is merely a particular type of classification, akin but not identical to the classifications performed by terms such as mimesis or verisimilitude. Thus it is nonsensical to claim that fiction qua concept does or does not exist at any given moment: fiction is foremost a way of grouping various literary practices, and it is those practices that emerge over time. The article then recasts the interest in the early novel’s fictionality shown by Catherine Gallagher and others as a problem of practices rather than of concepts. It tracks trends in subject matter and assertions of literal truth through a quantitative diachronic analysis of 230 years of French novels. While these trends cannot by their very nature show the birth of the concept of fiction—which was never born in the first place—they are the type of evidence that should be central to any future history of fiction. © 2021 by University of Washington",Conceptual history,Digital humanities,Fiction,Fictionality,Novel,,,,Paige N.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, the notion ephemera was used to denote the fragmented documents of everyday life. However, during the spread of contemporary digital culture, the notion of ephemerality has been widely used in discussing the production and reception of social media, digital literary and art works etc. Such cultural phenomena could be characterized as temporary and having a short lifespan. The objective of the present article is to examine the representation of ephemerality in case studies of Estonian digital culture, and to ask whether ephemerality could be considered a category of criticism in the study of representations of digital culture. For finding answers we examine in our article two different types of manifestations of digital culture in Estonia: digital literature created by Estonian authors, and digital literary heritage projects carried out in Estonia, which are presented as network-based interactive information environments. As a result of our research we conclude that we can analyze these examples of digital literature and digital literary historical projects in the context of ephemerality indeed. Thus, we argue, ephemerality is one of the essential notions which can be used in analyzing digital culture. © 2021, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Digital humanities,Digital literary heritage projects,Digital literature,Ephemerality,Estonian literature,,,,Viires P.,Laak M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standard digitally infused practices have not yet been applied to facilitate radical changes in pedagogy. Digital methods can be used to enhance graduate cohorts by enabling a community of learners in and outside the classroom; expand the definition of scholarship to challenge traditional academic hierarchies; draw regular connections between global colonial processes; question the ethics of writing imperial histories; and shift assessment practices away from students’ performance for the professor and toward individual self-reflection and communally defined standards.

Similarly, archaeologists regularly assume that raw material differences articulate with stone tool morphology, and the role of differential raw material quality and preference associated with Caddo lithic technology remains largely unexplored. Whether a particular artefact is found in or outside of burial contexts is a sensitive and regularly discussed topic in the archaeological literature, providing valuable insights related to prehistoric burial practices, as well as generational shifts in aesthetics, design, and raw material preferences. These assumptions were tested using geometric morphometrics, yielding results in support of the hypothesis that Perdiz arrow point shape is protean, and that significant differences existed in shape by time, raw material, and burial context. © 2021 The Author(s)",Computational archaeology,Digital archaeology,Digital humanities,Elliptical Fourier Analysis,Museum studies,NAGPRA,STEM,,Selden Jr. R.Z.,Dockall J.E.,Bousman C.B.,Perttula T.K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Safeguarding heritage is also valued highly in the priorities of the European Commission. As a result, there have been several long-term initiatives involving the digitisation, annotation and cataloguing of tangible cultural heritage in museums and collections. Specifically, for built heritage, a pressing challenge is that historical monuments such as buildings, temples, churches or city fortification infrastructures are hard to document due to their historic palimpsest; spatial transformations, actions of destruction, reuse of material, or continuous urban development that covers traces and changes the formal integrity and identity of a cultural heritage site. The ability to reason about a monument's form is crucial for efficient documentation and cataloguing. This paper presents a 3D digitisation workflow through the involvement of reality capture technologies for the annotation and structure analysis of built heritage with the use of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) for classification purposes. The presented workflow contributes a new approach to the identification of a building's architectural components (e.g., arch, dome) and to the study of the stylistic influences (e.g., Gothic, Byzantine) of building parts. In doing so this workflow can assist in tracking a building's history, identifying its construction period and comparing it to other buildings of the same period. This process can contribute to educational and research activities, as well as facilitate the automated classification of datasets in digital repositories for scholarly research in digital humanities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",3D data,Architectural structure,Convolutional neural network,Deep learning,Monument,,,,Deligiorgi M.,Maslioukova M.I.,Averkiou M.,Andreou A.C.,Selvaraju P.,Kalogerakis E.,Patow G.,Chrysanthou Y.,Artopoulos G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we perform an empirical study of a Chinese historical text, Records of the Three Kingdoms (Records), and a historical novel of the same story, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Romance). We employ deep-learning-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract characters and their relationships. The adopted NLP approach can extract 93% and 91% characters that appeared in the two books, respectively. Then, we characterize the social networks and sentiments of the main characters in the historical text and the historical novel. We find that the social network in Romance is more complex and dynamic than that of Records, and the influence of the main characters differs. These findings shed light on the different styles of storytelling in the two literary genres and how the historical novel complicates the social networks of characters to enrich the literariness of the story. © 2014 IEEE.",Complex networks,social network analysis (SNA),text mining,,,,,,Zhang C.,Zhang Q.,Yu S.,Yu J.J.Q.,Song X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Khodasevich's poems in ‘European Night’, marked with the dates and place of composition, and implicitly iterative of the contours of a Europe with which his original émigré audience was intimately familiar, represent both an autobiographical narrative and a cartographic attempt to sketch a conceptual map of European exile. Using four visualizations of the coordinates of Khodasevich's travel, composition, place, and publication to investigate the poet's experience and literary output in Europe during these years, I argue that the force of geography on literary production (literature in space) was especially active between 1922 and 1927.

In this project, students were asked to print and present to one another 3D objects representing Russia and then curate an exhibition of these objects.

Key to this comparison is the figure of Boris Iarkho, whose statistics- and biology-driven methodology based on large corpora of texts anticipated Digital Humanities by more than a half century. One of the main tasks of the article is to contextualize Iarkho's work. By comparing Iarkho with Franco Moretti, Matthew Jockers, and other Digital Humanists, I hope to demonstrate the relevance of Russian Formalism and Digital Humanities to one another. The former offers theoretical and methodological depth, the latter the opportunity to carry on with the projects launched by Iarkho and other Russian Formalists. At the same time, the comparison with Digital Humanities reveals some fundamental discrepancies within Russian Formalism, namely, between Iarkho and the group of Viktor Shklovskii. I show that they were diametrically opposed to each other in their understanding of literary evolution and form. I argue that these divergences, distinguishable in Russian Formalism thanks to Digital Humanities, can enrich our dialogue about the value, status, and meaning of literature. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Digital Humanities,Iarkho,Moretti,Russian Formalism,Shklovskii,,,,Lvoff B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Documentary films are considered among those objects defined as visual content and are therefore not the focus of most attention within Film Studies. One of the best-known researchers in this area, Bill Nichols, proposed a theoretical classification of six documentary voices that is widely recognized in academic circles. However, the classification is based on induction and intuition which, until now, have not been verified in accordance with the evidence. This study proposes a mixed qualitative and quantitative methodology that allows the authors to surpass Nichols’ model and generate a new classification based on empirical criteria. To that end, they study the opinions of users of and experts on Nichols’ theory through the card sorting technique borrowed from cognitive science that is based on multivariate statistics. In this way, they generate a hierarchy of formal cinematographic elements grouped into four documentary voices and Nicholas’ classification proposal is partly replaced as two of the voices in his model disappear but the four others are confirmed. In addition, this new model allows the authors to determine which formal elements are assigned to each one of the confirmed documentary modes and with what relative weights, thereby opening up the possibility of generating a predictive model. The article therefore demonstrates that cluster analysis and other techniques borrowed from multivariate statistics can be used to empirically and quantitatively verify theories in film studies as well as in other areas such as poetics. This suggests that it is possible to verify empirically and use quantitative models for the study of visual content and complement other methods based on induction and intuition. © The Author(s) 2019.",card sorting,cluster analysis,documentary film,study of film visual documentary,taxonomies,,,,Villanueva Baselga S.,Perez-Montoro M.,Sánchez L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of correspondences, acknowledgement of digital structure involves respecting the 'thing-like' properties of letters that cannot be handled (searched, classified, etc.) unless they are translated into digitized metadata; this elevates metadata to genuine digital research objects. These theoretical issues are illustrated by the Prior archive, a collection of digitized letters, manuscript drafts, and other 'grey' material bequeathed from the New Zealand logician-philosopher Arthur Norman Prior. The concept of the 'exploring mind' is connected to a movement in information science, away from the needful user and information gap paradigm towards more open and exploratory information behaviour in the digital humanities. A concluding literature review examines selected works of information science that deals with non-standard, serendipitous information behaviour and identifies exploratory and serendipitous design features of information systems for the digital humanities. These features are represented in a taxonomy consisting of six design categories. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EADH. All rights reserved.

In this article we firstly explore a philosophy of biodigitalism as a new paradigm closely linked to bioinformationalism. Both involve the mutual interaction and integration of information and biology, which leads us into discussion of biodigital convergence. As a unified ecosystem, this allows us to resolve problems that isolated disciplinary capabilities cannot, creating new knowledge ecologies within a constellation of technoscience. To illustrate our arrival at this historical flash point via several major epistemological shifts in the post-war period, we venture a tentative typology. The convergence between biology and information reconfigures all levels of theory and practice, and even critical reason itself now requires a biodigital interpretation oriented towards ecosystems and coordinated Earth systems. In this understanding, neither the digital humanities, the biohumanities, nor the posthumanities sit outside of biodigitalism. Instead, posthumanism is but one form of biodigitalism that mediates the biohumanities and the digital humanities, no longer preoccupied with the tradition of the subject, but with the constellation of forces shaping the future of human ontologies. This heralds a new biopolitics which brings the philosophy of race, class, gender, and intelligence, into a compelling dialog with genomics and information. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.",Biodigitalism,Biohumanities,Bioinformationalism,Biopolitics,Convergence,Digital humanities,Epistemology,Knowledge ecology,Peters M.A.,Jandrić P.,Hayes S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This form of similarity is investigated by performing a pose clustering of the human poses, which are modeled as 2D skeletons and are defined as sets of 14 points connected by limbs. To build a dataset of properly annotated artwork images (that is, including the 2D skeletons of the human figures represented), we relied on one of the most popular, recent, and accurate deep learning frameworks for pose tracking of human figures, namely OpenPose. To measure the similarity between human poses, two alternative distance functions are proposed. Moreover, we developed a modified version of the K-Medians algorithm to cluster similar poses and to find a limited number of poses that are representative of the whole dataset. The proposed approach was also compared to two popular clustering strategies, that is, K-Means and the Nearest Point Algorithm, showing higher robustness to outliers. Finally, we assessed the validity of the proposed framework, which we named POSE-ID-on, in both a qualitative and in a quantitative way by simulating a supervised setting, since we lacked a proper reference for comparison. © 2021 by the authors.",Digital humanities,Image retrieval,Pose clustering,Pose tracking,Warburg,,,,Marsocci V.,Lastilla L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the creation of such a corpus, the techniques of text analytics that have been applied in the analysis of English and other modern languages may now be applied to Tibetan. In this work, we narrow our focus to examine a modest portion of that literature, the Mind-section portion of the literature of the Tibetan tradition of the Great Perfection. Here, we will use the lens of text analytics tools based on machine learning techniques to investigate a number of questions of interest to scholars of this and related traditions of the Great Perfection. It has been necessary for us to participate in all portions of this process: corpora identification and text edition selection, rendering the text as e-Texts in Unicode using both Optical Character Recognition and manual entry, data cleaning and transformation, implementation of software for text analysis, and interpretation of results. For this reason, we hope this study can serve as a model for other low-resource languages that are just beginning to approach the problem of providing text analytics for their language. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This enormous productivity is due to the principle of variability and substitution in kennings. The phenomenon is discussed in Fidjestøl's 1974 structural analysis of the kenning system and presented there as a reversal of the principle of linguistic economy. This paper investigates this phenomenon by quantitatively analysing the kenning corpus as recorded in the skaldic database, in order to identify matching kennings within the corpus. The results are broken down according to the complexity of the kennings in question and are then examined in relation to the structural framework of the kenning system. It is shown, firstly, that a relatively small number of kennings are repeated (10-12 % of kennings are repeated), but that there is a fairly high amount of repetition among simple kennings (at least 25 % of simple kennings are found elsewhere in the corpus), suggesting that the kenning system has quantitative similarities with other linguistic systems, albeit with a much higher level of variability. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.",corpus analysis,digital humanities,kennings,Old Norse,skaldic poetry,statistics,,,Wills T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abstraction methods, like the “distant reading” of corpora, are increasingly important for knowledge discovery in the sciences and humanities. We demonstrate how abstraction methods complement the metrics on which research reviews currently rely. We model cross-disciplinary topics of research publications and projects emerging at multiple levels of detail in the context of an institutional review of the Earth Research Institute (ERI) at the University of California at Santa Barbara. From these, we design science maps that reveal the latent thematic structure of ERI's interdisciplinary research and enable reviewers to “read” a body of research at multiple levels of detail. We find that our approach provides decision support and reveals trends that strengthen the institutional review process by exposing regions of thematic expertise, distributions and clusters of work, and the evolution of these aspects. © 2021 The AuthorsMany institutions use metrics to evaluate their research productivity; however, it is challenging to effectively summarize and evaluate research across academic disciplines. We use topic modeling to develop maps of science at multiple levels of detail. The maps were used in an institutional review and evaluated by leading researchers at an earth science institute. We demonstrate that mapping research topics supports the review process by offering insights into interdisciplinary research collaborations and areas of expertise at the institute. © 2021 The AuthorsResearch institutes and organizations are interested in communicating the impact of their work and its value to a broader audience. However, quantifying impact and providing high-level views of interdisciplinary research trends are challenging. To address this, we leverage distant reading methods from the digital humanities to model the topics of a large body of interdisciplinary research products and visualize them in maps. We analyze 3,770 academic publications and grants affiliated with an interdisciplinary earth science research institute over a 10-year period and model its research topics.

Digitalization and innovative sphere of scholarly research, “digital humanities”, integrates the methodological apparatus and develops the potential of the humanities and engineering sciences under the condition of their effective interaction. One of the elements of the infrastructure of the digital humanities is research projects to create resources and databases of humanities knowledge. Problem Statement. Defining the concept of digital humanitarian project and its features is important for the development of interdisciplinary methodology of humanities and information technology. Purpose. The purpose is to substantiate the properties of Digital Humanitarian Project (DHP) as innovative research product, which is important in modern scientific communication and should be an officially recognized type of scholarly research electronic publication. Materials and Methods. Methods for historiographical and structural analysis and synthesis of DHP research concepts and completion of humanitarian digital projects at the NAS of Ukraine, and several other methods have been used. Results. For the first time the research has summarized the concept of DHP as interdisciplinary research product based on the analysis of modern concepts of digital humanities. Conclusions. The digital humanitarian project as a component of the digital humanities is an innovative research result and a type of scholarly research publication. The specific criteria are as follows: intellectual and innovative contribution of the interdisciplinary team to the development of scientific knowledge; importance for the development of educational and research infrastructure; influence on other DHP. The new model of scientific communication provides for the introduction and improvement of digital technologies in the processes of research and procedures for obtaining, processing, publishing, managing, and using scientific data, forming relevant humanities knowledge bases using achievements of socio-humanities, library and information activities etc. The criterion of new knowledge is not only a new content, but also new means of organization, classification, and interaction with this content. © 2020 Cultura.","Digital humanitarian project, digital humanities",,,,,,,,Dubrovina L.,Lobuzina K.,Onyshchenko O.,Boriak H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a matter of fact, recently architectural research has begun to take an interest in the problem ‘from within’, working not only on the application of computer tools but, more consciously, on their configuration. The work carried out by the Sapienza research group is aimed at developing ontologies and inferential models specifically dedicated to the representation of historical buildings and is devoted to the implementation of a national GIS platform for the historical centres, the Risk Map of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism. This kind of work involves a series of methodological issues specially oriented to the definition of the role of the history of architecture in itself and its use for the conservation project. These arguments are developed within this essay, mainly focused on: type and quality of information deriving by the new procedures; interpretative components that fuel the new research methods; cost/benefit ratio in the use of ‘analogue’ and ‘digital’ approaches; future prospects of the two different (traditional and digital) investigative strategies.

It compares two or more texts with each other aiming to find similar textual patterns, or to estimate in general how different or similar the texts are. Visualizing alignment results is an essential task, because it helps researchers getting a comprehensive overview of individual findings and the overall pattern structure. Different approaches have been developed to visualize and help making sense of these patterns depending on text size, alignment methods, and, most importantly, the underlying research tasks demanding for alignment. On the basis of those tasks, we reviewed existing text alignment visualization approaches, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes articles containing DH research in the Web of Science Core Collection as of December 2018. First, co-occurrence data representing collaborations among disciplinary were extracted from the subject category. Second, the descriptive statistics, network indicators and interdisciplinary communities were calculated. Third, the research topics of different interdisciplinary collaboration communities based on system keywords, author keywords, title and abstracts were detected. Findings: The findings reveal that while the scope of disciplines involved in DH research is broad and evolving over time, most interdisciplinary collaborations are concentrated among several disciplines, including computer science, library and information science, linguistics and literature. The study further uncovers some communities based on closely collaborating disciplines and the evolving nature of such interdisciplinary collaboration communities over time. To better understand the close collaboration ties, the study traces and analyzes the research topics and themes of the interdisciplinary communities. Finally, the implications of the findings for DH research are discussed. Originality/value: This study applied various informetric methods and tools to reveal the collaboration structure, patterns and themes among disciplinaries in DH research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities,Interdisciplinary collaboration,Library and information science,Network structure and patterns,Research topics,Visualization,,,Su F.,Zhang Y.,Immel Z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a systematic review of scientific publications that are representative of DH in Spain and were published between 2013 and 2018. The analysis considered doctoral theses, journal articles and conference papers. Findings: The results highlight the synergies between documentary heritage, LIS and DH. However, it appears that there is a scarcity of scientific literature to support the confluence of LIS and DH and a limited formal connection between heritage institutions and the areas of academia that reuse and enrich these source collections. Research limitations/implications: The review of representative scholarly DH publications was mainly based on the metadata that describe the content of articles, thesis and conference papers. This work relies on the thematic indexing (descriptors and keywords) of the analysed documents but their level of quality and consistency is very diverse. Originality/value: The topic of the study has not been explored before and this work could contribute to the international debate on the interrelation and complementarity between LIS and DH. In addition, this paper shows the contribution that standards and documentary methodologies make to projects in which technology is applied to humanities disciplines. The authors propose that there is an urgent need to strengthen the “scientific relationships” between heritage institutions, as well as enhancing links between the academic field of DH and LIS in order to improve teaching and research strategies in conjunction. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital collections,Digital humanities,Documentary methodologies,Documentary standards,Library and information science,,,,Alvite-Díez M.-L.,Barrionuevo L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wildlife in the Digital Anthropocene: Examining human-animal relations through surveillance technologies,1,10.1177/25148486211061704,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85137247992&doi=10.1177%2f25148486211061704&partnerID=40&md5=a90f79d16d8ddc30b427a2c35dda9e92,"Digital surveillance technologies enable a range of publics to observe the private lives of wild animals. Publics can now encounter wildlife from their smartphones, home computers, and other digital devices. These technologies generate public-wildlife relations that produce digital intimacy, but also summon wildlife into relations of care, commodification, and control. Via three case studies, this paper examines the biopolitical implications of such technologically mediated human-animal relations, which are becoming increasingly common and complex in the Digital Anthropocene. Each of our case studies involves a different biopolitical rationale deployed by a scientific-managerial regime: (1) clampdown (wild boar); (2) care (golden eagle); and (3) control (moose). Each of these modalities of biopower, however, is entangled with the other, inaugurating complex relations between publics, scientists, and wildlife. We show how digital technologies can predetermine certain representations of wildlife by encouraging particular gazes, which can have negative repercussions for public-wildlife relations in both digital and offline spaces. However, there remains work to be done to understand the positive public-wildlife relations inaugurated by digital mediation. Here, departing from much extant literature on digital human-animal relations, we highlight some of these positive potentials, notably: voice, immediacy, and agency. © The Author(s) 2021.",biopolitics,citizen sensing,digital animals,Digital Anthropocene,digital humanities,monitoring,nature 2.0,wildlife surveillance,von Essen E.,Turnbull J.,Searle A.,Jørgensen F.A.,Hofmeester T.R.,van der Wal R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Learning Digital Humanities in a Community of Practice: the DEAR model of Postgraduate Research Training,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85136381489&partnerID=40&md5=825272710211955c45121ac718fd61fc,"To date, there has been relatively little discussion of how the UK doctoral funding landscape shapes digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research students. This article sets out to address this relative lack, by introducing the inter-and multi-disciplinary context in which many students in the UK work. We examine the phenomenon of students who are not necessarily interested in becoming DH practitioners, but have identified DH as a knowledge gap in their own disciplinary practice. Such a realisation changes the nature of the learner within DH communities of practice, requiring a different form of learning. This study therefore explores learning within a community of practice, the inter-and multi-disciplinary space in which digital humanities practitioners operate. First, drawing on the diverse disciplinary landscape, it highlights an individual's learning journey through self-determined learning (heutagogy). Second, it outlines an idea of digital humanities pedagogy for postgraduate research based on current frameworks of digital literacies and broader researcher development in the UK, framing research activity as learning. Third, it presents the DEAR model for learning and teaching design, which is based on four principles: Diversity; Employability; Application; and Reflection. Finally, it provides an evaluation of the DEAR model in the context of one UK Doctoral Training Partnership (DTP). It contributes to understanding of pedagogical practices for doctoral-level DH training and provides a set of recommendations for instructors to adopt and adapt these pedagogical principles in their own programmes. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

On the other hand, the rise of digital reading on the web as well as the development of dedicated e-book readers has triggered a variety of hardware and software solutions to provide new reading environments and new material engagements with textual forms. In this paper, we propose a new metaphor, In-Out-In metaphor, to support the reading of literary works in a digital medium. Our model integrates information visualization techniques with plain text reading into the reading flow. This approach differs from the well-known dichotomy between close and distant reading because its emphasis is not on supporting the analysis of the texts being read, but on providing a smooth flow between focus and digression, which naturally occurs during a reading experience. We present a solution to read and explore the Book of Disquiet by Fernando Pessoa, an unfinished book composed of a set of modular texts that have been edited in different sequences and which can be read multi-sequentially. The research and design decisions for the visual reader of the Book of Disquiet are meant to provide an appealing, rich and interactive online reading experience through a web-based application, LdoD Visual. The implemented features apply information visualization techniques with an emphasis on exploring the modular nature of the book. Since this is a fragmentary literary work, its reading can be fragmentary as well, but providing a smooth multiple flow reading experience. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Different models were trained on a vast dataset of Burgundian diplomatic charters from the 9th to 14th centuries and validated by using general and century ad hoc models tested on short sets of Parisian, English, Italian and Spanish charters.

Compounded Mediation: A Data Archaeology of the Newspaper Navigator Dataset,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134664950&partnerID=40&md5=0507537b0c451f86569bd2b167e77cec,"The increasing roles of machine learning and artificial intelligence in the construction of cultural heritage and humanities datasets necessitate critical examination of the myriad biases introduced by machines, algorithms, and the humans who build and deploy them. From image classification to optical character recognition, the effects of decisions ostensibly made by machines compound through the digitization pipeline and redouble in each step, mediating our interactions with digitally-rendered artifacts through the search and discovery process. As a result, scholars within the digital humanities community have begun advocating for the proper contextualization of cultural heritage datasets within the socio-technical systems in which they are created and utilized. One such approach to this contextualization is the data archaeology, a form of humanistic excavation of a dataset that Paul Fyfe defines as “recover[ing] and reconstitut[ing] media objects within their changing ecologies” [Fyfe 2016]. Within critical data studies, this excavation of a dataset - including its construction and mediation via machine learning - has proven to be a capacious approach. However, the data archaeology has yet to be adopted as standard practice among cultural heritage practitioners who produce such datasets with machine learning. In this article, I present a data archaeology of the Library of Congress’s Newspaper Navigator dataset, which I created as part of the Library of Congress’s Innovator in Residence program [Lee et al. 2020]. The dataset consists of visual content extracted from 16 million historic newspaper pages in the Chronicling America database using machine learning techniques. In this case study, I examine the manifold ways in which a Chronicling America newspaper page is transmuted and decontextualized during its journey from a physical artifact to a series of probabilistic photographs, illustrations, maps, comics, cartoons, headlines, and advertisements in the Newspaper Navigator dataset [Fyfe 2016]. Accordingly, I draw from fields of scholarship including media archaeology, critical data studies, science and technology studies, and the autoethnography throughout. To excavate the Newspaper Navigator dataset, I consider the digitization journeys of four different pages in Black newspapers included in Chronicling America, all of which reproduce the same photograph of W.E.B. Du Bois in an article announcing the launch of The Crisis, the official magazine of the NAACP. In tracing the newspaper pages’ journeys, I unpack how each step in the Chronicling America and Newspaper Navigator pipelines, such as the imaging process and the construction of training data, not only imprints bias on the resulting Newspaper Navigator dataset but also propagates the bias through the pipeline via the machine learning algorithms employed. Along the way, I investigate the limitations of the Newspaper Navigator dataset and machine learning techniques more generally as they relate to cultural heritage, with a particular focus on marginalization and erasure via algorithmic bias, which implicitly rewrites the archive itself. In presenting this case study, I argue for the value of the data archaeology as a mechanism for contextualizing and critically examining cultural heritage datasets within the communities that create, release, and utilize them. I offer this autoethnographic investigation of the Newspaper Navigator dataset in the hope that it will be considered not only by users of this dataset in particular but also by digital humanities practitioners and end users of cultural heritage datasets writ large. © 2021, DHQ: Digital Humanities Quarterly.

After a historical overview of the context in which these periodicals were created and taking into account the research literature already available, the first step was to look for parallels in their formal design. Since both newspapers have also been digitally made accessible in full text recently, it was also possible to determine approximately how frequent direct mutual references to the other periodical occur by means of so-called distant reading procedures. Close reading methods were then used to examine and interpret the corpus-based references.

These networks help to reshape our understanding of the “publics” of academia by breaking down the binary between the public and academic. They point toward ways in which more nuanced networks of affinity between the academy and the public may be constructed and negotiated by embracing the digital and the open.

This part focuses on data collection, which is carefully distinct from data interpretation. In the context of a layered and distributed architecture, the system provides a number of components, which get composed into an analysis pipeline configured to fit a specific scenario (e.g. poetry or prose, Greek or Latin, appositives detection, etc.). The data model for its results is inspired by the linguistic structures underlying the analysis, up to the most granular level of phonemes and traits, and gets stored into a rdbms, together with the texts and its metadata. This provides a fully detailed metric database, usable as a sort of laboratory for making observations and data analysis. Yet, the architecture is designed to cope with a highly variable level of granularity in its input documents, including true lack of information, so that the system can produce results even with unmarked text sources. Prosodical, syntactical and metrical analysis are capable of handling even the lowest level of information, and their algorithms are designed to extract as much data as possible by leveraging the system’s linguistic and metrical competences. At the same time, they can also take advantage of any number and type of additional resources, through integration of third party functionalities, either at the beginning of the analysis process (e.g. macronizers or pos taggers), or at its end (e.g. data science tools, machine learning techniques, etc.). An overview of the system architecture and analysis flow, from text to metrical scan through prosodies and syntax, provides a number of methodologically relevant insights on the system, and on the role and potential of such tools in scholarly research and digital publications. © 2021 Fabrizio Serra Editore.

In order to write a good Tiyao even the most eminent scholars spent a lot of time and effort in collecting collating reviewing and annotating large-scale book collections. However confronted with large-scale rare-book collections even though we pay huge human efforts on writing editing and recommending Tiyaos this task is still time-consuming and omissions are inevitable. In this paper we propose a Tiyao-centric network model which integrates rare-books historic figures and Tiyaos into one tripartite graph. This network model is not limited to the language or scale of texts and can be further applied to large-scale catalogues of rare-book collections. Based on this model we construct a Tiyao explorative tool TiyaoX. By using SPARQL this tool can extract RDF data in related knowledge bases and provide users with information of rare-book authors or editors for instance occupation imperial examination biography and so on. Furthermore this tool can automatically extract the individual relations embedded in Tiyaos enrich the existing resources with reliable and valuable relation information in addition this tool leverages metadata and content features of Tiyaos to recommend potential interesting and query-relevant e. g. Tiyao content category book name an author relevant Tiyaos. In this paper we use Siku Quanshu Zongmu as dataset and on the one hand we investigate the latent relations among rare-books historic figures and Tiyaos. We also make separate quantitative analysis towards person names and book names in four divisions of this dataset respectively. The results demonstrate that Tiyaos in Ji division contain most names of historical persons and books and Tiyaos in Jing division contain names least. Tiyaos in Zi and Ji divisions have the maximum overlap of person names and Tiyaos in Shi and Zi divisions have the maximum overlap of book names. In the constructed network most key figures are Confucius scholars book collectors and bibliographers and most important rare-books are descriptive catalogues Confucian classics and history books. On the other hand we take advantage of descriptive features in Tiyao content author introduction content summary and critics and combine them with Tiyao meatada as well as three text recommendation strategies Cosine similarity LDA + JS distance and Word2Vec + RWMD. Our objective is to evaluate the impacts of different content features on the accuracy of recommendation module of TiyaoX respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the approach that integrates summary critique information and Tiyao metadata information as content features performs best among all results. This approach can be extended to knowledge discovery of rarebook collections which provides convenience for related professionals scholars and enthusiasts and improves efficiency in practice. 4 figs. 6 tabs. 51 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

Combined with the characteristics and development stages of digital humanities research this paper constructs and discusses the evaluation of digital humanities from three dimensions of discipline professionalism and technicality. Discipline is the core element and the evaluation of digital humanities achievements depends on whether it promotes the practical and academic innovation in the field of humanities. Professionalism is the key element. Library information and archives science builds basic data facilities for digital humanities and provides methodological guidance for digital humanities by using its professional knowledge of information organization retrieval and analysis. It is also the medium and link connecting disciplines and technologies. Technology is an essential element. Information technology natural language processing technology semantic web technology and text mining technology are applied to human data analysis to help academic innovation and knowledge innovation in the field of humanities. In the field of library information and archives we should give full play to the advantages of professional knowledge technology application professional talents and professional organizations strengthen interdisciplinary exchanges and cooperation and help promote theoretical innovation knowledge innovation discipline innovation and method innovation in the field of humanities. At the same time we should learn from the existing evaluation research results and practical experience to lead the evaluation of digital human achievements. 1 tab. 19 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

New Modality of Applied Research on Cultural Heritage under the Action of IIIF and AI,0,10.13530/j.cnki.jlis.2021013,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127894376&doi=10.13530%2fj.cnki.jlis.2021013&partnerID=40&md5=0f46dfb77918cb5e06e6032fea87204e,"Culture Heritages are non-renewable and precious resources. How to make the cultural relics collected in museums the heritage displayed on the vast land and characters written in ancient books all come alive is a proposition that all mankind should think and study. The International Image Interoperability Framework IIIF has developed a series of standard API interfaces that aim to ensure the interoperability and accessibility of global image resources storage. Based on the open data five-star model the paper first proposes a five-star model for open images image online high-quality images annotated images open standards and semantic connection. Among them the former three stars focus on the readable characteristics of images and the last two stars focus on availability feature. Subsequently based on the two major technologies of IIIF framework and Artificial Intelligence AI the paper proposes a technical framework for the deep application of image resources in cultural heritage. In the framework the IIIF part is mainly responsible for the organization and presentation of image resources through the four published API interface standards while the AI technologies can be used to realize the recognition and comprehension of image contents. Specifically the IIIF Image API specifies a web service that returns an image in response to a standard HTTP or HTTPS request. The IIIF Presentation API is to provide the information necessary to allow a rich online viewing environment. The IIIF Search API lays out the interoperability mechanism for searching annotation content within a single IIIF resource. And the IIIF Authentication API describes a set of workflows for guiding the user through an existing access control system. In AI implementation part digitalization mainly realizes the reorganization of different image resources. Different technologies need to be adopted according to the type of image text image and non-text image in textualization. Conceptualization is to identify and extract entities from textual content. Through semantic connection the semantic annotation knowledge association and content enhancement of image resources can be realized. From the perspective of application smart application explores the realization of semantic services and in-depth application of images through knowledge graphs. In the case part the paper uses semantic technologies such as IIIF linked data graph database and ontology to build IIIF-IIP system an immersion-style interactive platform which includes the process of publishing annotation linking and reuse of image resources. And this platform supports the online interaction of ultra-high definition and super-giant image resources with billions of pixels and explores an ecological way that allows cultural heritage to release connect and live. At the end the paper takes part of the flower-related collection resources of Vincent Van Gogh’s works published by different collection institutions as an example to verify the feasibility of the implementation plan and technical path of the paper which will play a good guidance and reference for the dissemination and research of traditional cultures. Although the IIIF framework is still being improved it does not affect the technology that has become a hot spot pursued by cultural heritage institutions. The combination of IIIF and AI will usher in a new era of digital humanities research and jointly help the effective protection inheritance and research of image resources in cultural heritage. 10 figs. 1 tab. 24 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

"Discovering,Reorganizing and Storytelling: Paths and Methods of Archives Research on the Perspective of Digital Humanities",1,10.13530/j.cnki.jlis.2021007,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127866122&doi=10.13530%2fj.cnki.jlis.2021007&partnerID=40&md5=5ee421b6a5642a48f5aebe7d3a930963,"Digital humanities DH aims to solve problems in humanities by using digital ideas and technologies in the fields of computers and the Internet. Nowadays DH has a significant impact on the concepts and models of Library Archival & Information Science LIS. However compared to Library & Information Science Archival Science has neither comprehensively accepted the ideas and technologies from DH nor revealed its value in research paths and methods to DH. In some DH researches archives are only the secondary resources or objects while the results or conclusions of these researches are not related to Archival Science. Thus it is an essential to promote in-depth interaction between DH and Archival Science at the level of research methodology and to mine archives value from the multidimensional perspective. By integrating the concepts and technologies this paper puts forward a two-tiers framework in the paths and methods of archives research on the perspective of DH. First based on theories and practices of archival science the authors analyze the theoretical basis and mapping mechanism of archives research in DH background including some core elements such as philosophy basis research objects service models and etc. Second through reviewing papers and ideas of multi-disciplines a new model of archives research paths has been proposed. We define the archives research paths as the three core primitives called discovering reorganizing and storytelling. Specifically discovering is deconstructed to three sub-primitives containing positioning contexts recognizing and mining in order to discover all the memory entities and their relationships in archives resource without any prejudice. Reorganizing includes static relating and dynamic clustering which are implemented by building knowledge organization models such as Simple Event Ontology SEM and International Council on Archives Records in Contexts Ontology ICA RiC-O as well as adding semantic labels to represent an entity from different perspectives. User detecting framework constructing and archives narrating are fused as storytelling to furthering the distant reading of archives resources. Third correspondingly the authors operate the three primitives to data processing technologies from the perspective of archives value 1 Maintaining the value aiming to transform multi-modal archives to archives data. 2 Mining the value focusing on the dynamic and flexible knowledge organization of archives data. 3 Realizing the value paying attention to the contextual and immersive narrative of archives data. Then this paper selects archives data sets of archivist Wu Baokang as research case to validate the rationality and effectiveness of the paths and methods proposed above and tries to tell some stories about Wu Baokang with different topics. Ultimately we find that the new paths and methods of archives research on the perspective of DH could demonstrate the lofty beliefs and academic qualities of the older generation LIS scholars in New China. In the follow-up research we will focus on the limitations and problems pay attention to the collection and organization of archives with multiple types and sources. We will also set some standards about user participation in archives data description and organization while asking users opinions related to our knowledge discovery and service platform. In conclusion we believe that the paths and methods mentioned above will induce more thinking about the archives resources development and archival science research. Scholars from library & information science and archival science should discover more consistent research methods and interests in DH environment. 11 figs. 2 tabs. 40 refs. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

Review and Outlook of Data Visualization Literacy,0,10.13530/j.cnki.jlis.2021014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127842660&doi=10.13530%2fj.cnki.jlis.2021014&partnerID=40&md5=7b7d8e1d74c58ed49b35402b900f5b96,"For library and information science LIS literacy is an important research domain such as information literacy and data literacy both improving the impact of LIS on society. Especially libraries and librarians can always act as good leaders to drive the research education and application of literacy. Utilizing the source of library fully to promote citizens literacy has been a duty and opportunity for libraries to serve the society. With the literacy elements of literacy data visualization literacy becomes a new direction of literacy research and education proposed by Katy Borner in PNAS and a new research topic nominated to LIS by big data because data visualization literacy is one basic literacy for people in the era of the data economy. Data visualization literacy aims to explore and discover the value of big data and make data sense in visualization. The data range and significance in data visualization literacy are different from those in media literacy visual literacy visualization literacy and information literacy. The rest of the paper is organized into five sections. Section I depicts the development process of data visualization literacy from visual literacy visual information literacy visual literacy standards to visualization literacy and compares the differences among these conceptions about visualization literacy. Section II gives the ability framework of data visualization literacy such as insight needs data scales analyses visualizations graphic symbols graphic variables interactions and programming etc. Section III presents the forging mechanism of data visualization literacy—how cognition is forged with encountering visualization floundering on visualization constructing a frame exploring visualization questioning the frame etc and the forging process of data visualization literacy—how ability is accumulated when insight needs acquire data analyse visualize interactive deploy and interpret. Section IV concludes the test theory such as Evidence Centred Design & Item Response Theory the dimensions the methods and the visualizations of data visualization literacy measurement. In Section V an integrated research framework of data visualization literacy is constructed covering education research and application. The integrated research framework we proposed aims to strengthen the literacy elements forging and measurement and contribute to the exploration in influence factor education pattern promotion strategy and assessment. Meanwhile we emphasize security right and ethics as the important base of data visualization literacy and look into the future of the research. As far as we can see data visualization literacy will make a significant impact on LIS especially for library science data science and digital humanities. It will be a new research and education direction in LIS. In the view of the application data visualization literacy will play an excellent role in business development and service promotion for libraries and contribute to the construction of smart libraries in ways of visualizing data source and knowledge source intelligent recommendation accelerating the acquirement and adoption of knowledge. Data visualization literacy will contribute to the pattern of data-driven knowledge discovery rooted the library.

Semantic modeling of textual entities: The CRMtex model and the ontological description of ancient texts,0,10.6092/issn.2532-8816/13674,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127715633&doi=10.6092%2fissn.2532-8816%2f13674&partnerID=40&md5=a4b21ce39a57b822cfd8efed7f17bac9,"This paper presents CRMtex, an ontological model based on CIDOC CRM developed since 2015 to support the study of ancient documents. The model is intended to identify relevant textual entities and to model the scientific process related to the investigation of ancient texts and their features in order to foster integration with other Cultural Heritage research fields. CRMtex is able to identify and define in a clear and unambiguous way the main entities involved in the study and edition of ancient handwritten texts and to describe them by means of appropriate ontological instruments in a multidisciplinary perspective. The CRMtex model also provides tools for managing this kind of complexity by defining classes and properties for describing a handwritten text in all its aspects, from its creation (and/or destruction) in the past, down to its present conservation, investigation and study by scholars, including its transcription, translation, interpretation and publication. The full compatibility of CRMtex with the CIDOC CRM ontology and its extensions ensures persistent interoperability of data encoded by means of its entities with other semantic information produced in cultural heritage and Digital Humanities. © 2021, University of Bologna Department of Classical and Italian Philology, Alma Mater Studiorum.

In this article, we present the results of a research project aiming to produce annotated resources for three regional languages of France: Alsatian, Occitan, and Picard. These languages cover three different language families (Germanic and two subfamilies of Romance, Oïl and Oc languages) and different sociolinguistic situations. Yet, they all face issues common to many under-resourced languages: lack of human and financial resources and presence of geolinguistic variation. The originality of this project is that it brought together researchers from different fields (sociolinguistics, descriptive linguistics, dialectology, natural language processing, digital humanities) to work together towards the common goal of developing annotated corpora for Alsatian, Occitan, and Picard. This created a favorable and stimulating working environment which could not have been achieved had different research groups worked independently, each on a single language.

While it is not necessarily possible to infer a performance from the existence of the sheet music, it is at least possible to infer a particular interest in the works. The unique RISM catalogue, which has been collecting musical materials from all over the world since 1952, now records a corpus of over one million handwritten sources and is electronically exploitable. Due to the advanced usability of the RISM website, it is possible to get an overview of the distribution of individual composers and works. If it were still possible to make accessible not only the current storage locations but also the original provenance, the historical dissemination of composers and works could be documented on a larger scale. This would open up a collection of sources that would provide a basis for the representation of the musical environment at certain times and for the determination of musical cultural regions. © 2021 Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre.

Transforming Information Into Knowledge: How Computational Methods Reshape Art History,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85126268361&partnerID=40&md5=f778fce4aabee4775a5ff7f1db095aed,"Current research in computer vision highlights the potential of using computational methods to analyze and access large datasets of real images and videos, performing tasks such as object detection or finding visual similarities. This essay describes how the application of these computational methods to digital art data transforms information inherent in images into new knowledge. We support this claim by presenting various research examples in the field of digital art history, which utilize computational methods for art analysis. We argue that in order to create new knowledge, we must involve transformative processes — from analog to digital data and digital to computational methods. Traditional methods used in art history to access datasets, link or edit images provide suggestions and validations for current practices, but are not sufficient role models for the processing of digital data because they were developed under varying technological conditions and standards and within a different historical context. Aby Warburg’s (1866-1929) Mnemosyne Atlas, which aimed to visualize visual continuities from antiquity to the Renaissance, is one method often cited in the context of digital humanities. We argue that the characteristics of digital data, for example being reproducible or modifiable, require innovative computer methods that do not have a direct analog counterpart. Our argument is based on the success of current projects and personal experience: the authors have expertise in computer vision and art history. They have created and applied computational methods to analyze art data and are thus able to identify shortcomings of traditional approaches and suggest possible solutions. Eventually this essay presents solutions, which demonstrate the great potential of computational methods for a data analysis: approaches enable an easy and explorative access to digital image collections through visualization techniques or an automatic object search. Computational methods establish links between thousands of images, thereby identifying the adaptation of specific motifs or styles by artists over time, or enable a conspicuous editing of images, thus providing new insights for art history unobtainable with analog methods. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Based on the concept of digital curation, this paper proposes a digital curation model of local historical research data, and uses the two ancient forts of Keelung and Tamsui left over from the Spanish-Dutch period in northern Taiwan in the 17th century as examples. We start with the relevant historical material, collecting, screening, and compiling literature data, carry out field surveys and digitize the collected materials for processing and preservation. Furthermore, consider the subsequent access, presentation and reuse of digital content in order to transform it into popular science content suitable for public viewing. Finally, through the development and presentation of 3D models, the actual experience of VR virtual curation, plus the production and broadcasting of videos, the integration of virtual and real is carried out. In addition, this research also promotes online curation in response to the Covid-19 epidemic. The benefits can be learned from the analysis of online viewing data that digital curation does have the effect of not being restricted by time and space. © 2021.

The backdrop is the Spanish critical discourse on literature between 1943 and 1954. Gurrea’s book Cuentos de Juana was published in Spain at the end of 1943. The following year, Carmen Laforet won the Nadal prize with her celebrated novel Nada. In 1951, Gurrea’s book won the international prize awarded by the Union Latine in Paris. In 1954, Isabel Calvo included both writers in her Antología biográfica de escritoras españolas (Anthology and Biography of Spanish Women Writers). Spanish literary critics praised Gurrea’s work as a product of Spain, but highlighted her condition as a Philippine writer, wrapping their discourse on colonialism and Francoist national-Catholicism. I analyze the reviews published in Spain about Cuentos de Juana in order to understand how the Francoist discourse appropriated Gurrea’s work, alongside her actively engaging in displaying her Filipino identity. For this purpose, I employ two approaches. Firstly, I use language analysis techniques from the corpus linguistics discipline, using Voyant Tools software (2012). Secondly, I propose a discussion on the Spanish literary criticism during the postwar period, by looking at the literary critics and how their ideological setting framed their position with regards to Adelina Gurrea’s place in Spanish literature. © Ateneo de Manila University.",Corpus linguistics,Digital humanities,Hispanic-Philippine literature,Nadal prize for literature,Spanish women writers,,,,Álvarez-Tardío B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a wide range of methodological perspectives, this paper also examines the relationship between literature and the Earth sciences, thus envisioning a new type of literary history where the Romanian novel should be thought as existing within hyper-objects, such as the climate, agriculture, wilderness, pollution, biosphere, cultural politics, capitalism, or geology. The article finally addresses the issue of zoopoetics both as an object of study in the MDRR digital archive (1845-1947) and as a reading strategy, thus, favoring the relationship between animality and narrativity. © 2021, Complexul National Muzeal Astra Sibiu.

This article takes a different view, namely that we need to consider this diversity through multiple 'frames' of digitally-mediated language and culture, and that this is not just a question of epistemic justice or community manners, but that the digital humanities also need to address more actively challenges around global dynamics of digital multilingualism, transcultural exchange and geodiversity in its research agenda. This paper explores these questions through the prism of 'language indifference' in digital studies and, responding to Galina's call for better data on the state of geolinguistic diversity in DH (2014), it articulates possible frameworks for addressing this diversity in a strategic, programmatic and research-led manner. We conclude by exploring the role of a greater multilingual focus in what Liu calls 'the techne of diversity' in digital humanities (2020), and contend that the digital humanities has much to gain, and much to offer, in engaging more fully with the languages-related cultural challenges of our era. © 2021 Open Library of Humanities.

The Taiwan Biographical Database (TBDB) assembles biographical information of historical personages in Taiwan. It is a digital-humanities-oriented system that supports relational database operations, fulltext search, social network analysis, and geographic information system functions. Objectives.Through semi-automatic named entity recognition from the fulltext of biographies, TBDB assists historians to construct networks of social relationships. However, the fulltext of biographies may not describe all social relationships. Taking advantage of the fact that historical photographs were usually taken on formal occasions, historical photographs may be exploited to uncover additional relationships. This paper describes and evaluates a face detection function in TBDB that utilizes the OpenCV Library to detect faces of historical persons in old photographs. Furthermore, it employs hierarchical agglomerative clustering to combine fragmentary social networks. Results. An experiment using 45 historical photographs found that the face detection function achieved an average recall of 98% recall, but with low precision. To address the low precision rate, a user interface has been implemented in TBDB to facilitate review and deletion of false-positive faces in the photographs. Furthermore, cluster analysis is used to integrate social relationships found in biographies, those detected from historical photographs, and even relationships harvested from external sources, to produce comprehensive social networks for historical research. © 2021, The authors Published by WKW School of Communication & Information & NTU Libraries, Nanyang Technological University",,,,,,,,,Sie S.H.,Ke H.R.,Chang S.B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is argued that the lexical method is better than the normative and analytical methods at finding democracies in the world. The argument then turns to demonstrating, mainly through computational research conducted within the Google Books catalog, that an empirically demonstrable imbalance exists between the democracies mentioned in the literature. The remainder of the argument is given to explaining the value of working to correct this imbalance, which comes in at least three guises: (1) studying marginalized democracies can increase our options for alternative democratic actions and democratic innovations; (2) it leads to a conservation and public outreach project, which is epitomized in an “encyclopedia of the democracies”; and (3) it advocates for a decolonization of democracies’ definitions and practices and decentering academic democratic theory. © 2021,Democratic Theory.

Carthaginian coin finds: A database of geolocated numismatic finds,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123540312&partnerID=40&md5=4cb864967d828ad07cc9a83677411c3b,"Coins minted under the authority of the Carthaginian State have traditionally had a minor visibility compared to other issues. Although obvious historical reasons could be argued to explain it, historiographical and epigraphical factors have also contributed to the fact that Carthaginian coinage is still poorly known. This has also led to a lack of attention on how coins were used by the Carthaginian society. The Digital Humanities offer tools that allow us to contribute and mitigate the great dispersion that the information on the Carthaginian numismatic phenomenon currently suffers. This paper presents a contribution of that sort: An on-line database that centralizes, standardizes, geolocates and makes more visible the documentation already published on Greek coin finds in Carthage (Tunisia). © 2021 Ediciones Hecate.

It describes the central process of single-letter revision that forms the basis of the Second Edition, as well as several ancillary revision projects that have impacted upon the dictionary as a whole: the introduction of references to cognate dictionaries, of a semantic tag, of a chronology of dated citations, and (for the future) of a language tag. The digital format allows for a modular approach to revision that has already expanded a purely semantic dictionary to one with historical, etymological and onomasiological elements. A new grant now allows for the completion of the Second Edition, initiated in the 1990s. This article shows the significance of this achievement, while arguing that as an online resource the Anglo-Norman Dictionary can continue to grow in several ways.

On the one hand, it describes how to adapt two natural language processing tools to medieval Galician-Portuguese, namely a morphosyntactic analyzer and a medieval language recognizer, and on the other hand, it verifies linguistic hypotheses about the evolution of medieval suffixes by using these tools by using historical corpora. Although the performance of the tools is inferior to those used for more standardized modern varieties with less formal variability, we show that it is possible to use them with great reliability for quantitative corpus-based studies. The corpus-based linguistic study allows us to verify that, on the basis of their frequency distribution, the presence of the suffixes -CION and -BLE in medieval Galician texts is probably influenced by medieval Castilian. © 2021 Universidade do Minho.

The increased level of digitization has affected the scholarly practice in multiple ways, most of which positive, including the increased usability and accessibility of source materials, primary and secondary literature and instruments for quantitative analysis. Digitization, however, also presents major challenges which have not always been properly identified, let alone solved, yet, such as the long-term sustainability of publications, cultural biases in digitization policies or the pressure on Dutch as a scientific publication language in a digital, and thus increasingly globalized academic world.

This article draws on interviews with Digital Humanities practitioners in higher education conducted in 2017–2018 in three Nordic countries to introduce the concept of the ‘work-work balance’, an under-researched phenomenon in contemporary academe. The term ‘work-work balance’ refers to the ways in which workers in higher education seek to balance conflicting concurrent work demands made on them. Four such work scenarios emerged from the data: the 50/50 split across different jobs; working across multiple projects simultaneously; occupying multiple functional roles; and conflicting demands within one job. The article argues that work-work balance, or rather imbalance, issues result in the inability of higher education workers to meet the demands put upon them. This raises questions regarding the role of HEIs and research funding regimes in the generation and maintenance of work-work balance scenarios and suggests that work-work balance issues need to be researched further as well as requiring urgent attention from HEIs and research funders. © 2022 The Author(s).

By some accounts, there are 1,200 editions of the work published in thirty world languages, all of which trace back to a single manuscript-itself a copy of an earlier Mayan work. To protect their work from being destroyed by colonial officials or Inquisitional authorities, the original K'iche' authors of the Popol Wuj had to embed their ways of knowing in a language and narrative structure that could not be detected by Spanish readers. Each edition of the Popol Wuj therefore helps to uncover different elements of the cosmovisión that is embedded in the text. This article draws from recent collaborative efforts to prepare a digital critical edition of the PopolWuj based on the editorial standards and scholarly conventions of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI).

The first epoch was when the oral text was written down. The second was when the German scribe Guttenberg invented the printing press, and the handwritten text became printed. Now text is becoming digital, and there is a natural digitalization of all spheres of human activity, including the legacy of Dostoevsky. Modern information technologies create a new type of text that not only preserves the advantages of oral, handwritten and printed text, but also acquires new capabilities. The digital text expands the range of sources, the volume of information, and stimulates new methods of studying the writer’s creative work. Despite the fact that electronic libraries, which currently dominate the Internet, present digital copies of Dostoevsky’s printed publications, new types of electronic publications and new tools for analyzing not only handwritten and printed, but also digital text, are emerging. The idea of Digital Dostoevsky is being implemented in Petrozavodsk University projects (since 1995), the Institute of Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of Sciences (since 2016), and the University of Toronto (since 2019). Lexicographic work on Dostoevsky’s vocabulary is being carried out in digital format at the Russian Language Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The article provides an overview and outlines the prospects for the development of Digital Dostoevsky. An important task of the global Digital Dostoevsky is the creation of national bibliographies and electronic libraries and publication of new sources related to the writer’s life and work.

This, in turn, brings new possibilities for both industry and humanities. Industry gains a new way of human-computer interaction based on the brain wave analysis that allows controlling computers by mental activity. The humanities like psychology, sociology, political science, and linguistics can utilize the brain activity patterns during experiments to measure and classify reactions of informants to different modelled situations thereby increasing the precision and objectivity of research results. One of the most convenient ways to monitor brain activity is the non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG). To conduct the EEG-based research, stimuli representation tools are required as well, which should support the synchronization mechanisms with the EEG hardware. In spite of many existing software platforms devoted to conducting EEG-based experiments, high-level versatile tools are badly needed by scholars, especially the ones who do not have much experience in programming, signal processing, and hardware management. In this paper, we propose an adaptable ontology-driven toolchain for conducting EEG-based neurophysiological experiments applied to various scientific domains including digital humanities and computational linguistics. This toolchain provides a high-level graphical user interface that does not require special IT skills for customization. By modifying the underlying ontologies, this toolchain can be easily tuned to the specifics of particular experiment setups, as well as integrated with different third-party EEG hardware and signal processing software. Herewith, the toolchain’s core requires no source code modifications. The high-level graphical user interface of the toolchain provides the user with a data flow diagram (DFD) editor that enables defining the particular data processing pipeline in an intuitive way instead of programming the data processing from scratch. This solution is built upon our ontology-driven visual analytics platform called SciVi. In the present work, new SciVi capabilities are introduced, which allow this platform to be utilized for conducting neurophysiological experiments. The main new features cover the representation of audiovisual stimuli, as well as retrieving, processing, and analyzing the EEG data. Using the approach proposed, we successfully composed the particular toolchain incorporating medical-grade EEG device EBNeuro Be Plus LTM, related calibration, data acquisition, and visualization methods along with such data processing algorithms as Linear Discriminant Analysis, Common Spatial Patterns, and Power Spectral Density. This particular toolchain was utilized to conduct preliminary neurophysiological experiments related to discrimination of brain activity by reading words with certain linguistic features in three different tasks: visual stimuli vs their absence, meaningful stimulus vs placeholder, and transitive verb vs intransitive verb. Brain activity patterns for some of the tasks were obtained. © 2021 National Research Nuclear University.

In tracking the different editions of the Norton and Heath anthologies of American literature, the tool becomes particularly adept at identifying diachronic and nonce canons—texts that appear to identify an inner core over time and those that circulate at its edges. In our essay, we also note that while racial and ethnic diversity have generally expanded, that expansion has come in spurts and in some ways stalled. Moreover, geographic diversity has remained static, or even shrunk. Finally, the essay considers how the presentation of material in anthologies shapes interpretation. The anthology—as a form, as a genre—seems to reinforce historicist approaches to early American literature, and recent selections of texts suggest that the field has moved even further toward emphasizing such historicist methods. Ultimately, we hope to advance a discussion about anthologies and the texts they make most readily available for teaching early American literature. © 2021 University of North Carolina Press.

Intricate language rules and their exceptions, as well as poetic licenses exerted by the authors, make calculating these patterns a nontrivial task. Some rhetorical devices shrink the metrical length, while others might extend it. This opens the door for interpretation and further complicates the creation of automated scansion algorithms useful for automatically analyzing corpora on a distant reading fashion. In this paper, we compare the automated metrical pattern identification systems available for Spanish, English, and German, against fine-tuned monolingual and multilingual language models trained on the same task. Despite being initially conceived as models suitable for semantic tasks, our results suggest that transformers-based models retain enough structural information to perform reasonably well for Spanish on a monolingual setting, and outperforms both for English and German when using a model trained on the three languages, showing evidence of the benefits of cross-lingual transfer between the languages. © 2021, The Author(s).",Digital humanities,Language models,Natural language processing,Poetry,,,,,de la Rosa J.,Pérez Á.,de Sisto M.,Hernández L.,Díaz A.,Ros S.,González-Blanco E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study first determines historical researchers’ basic procedure when investigating wooden slips, and discerns 10 functional primitives for these scholarly activities. It then proposes “Wooden Slip Research Ontologies” composed of interrelated “Wooden Slip,” “Chinese Character,” and “Annotation” ontologies to support digital wooden slip research and enable the cross-institutional search for Chinese characters. Finally, the integration of the Wooden Slip Dictionary and the Multi-database Search System for Historical Chinese Characters demonstrates how interoperable design applies to digital humanities image platforms © 2021, Journal of Educational Media and Library Sciences.

In recent years, applications of SNA by historians and history-adjacent scholars have also increased dramatically, partly as a product of the growing field of digital humanities. In the North American sense of the term, the utility of social network analysis has yet to be substantively realized by historical archaeologists. In this paper, we use two case studies from the southeastern United States to illustrate the potential that social network analyses could offer historical archaeologists. In particular, we highlight how social network analysis can be employed as a framework for the integrated consideration of both archaeological and documentary evidence to explore the distribution, accumulation, control, and production of social capital in the past. In our first case study we leverage archaeological networks as a proxy for social capital to explore the contradictions and complementarity of archaeological data and the ethnohistorical record on the Indigenous politics of sixteenth-century Southern Appalachia. In our second example we examine networks of tasks and spaces across a nineteenth-century enslaved community on the Georgia Coast to understand how social capital can be differentially accumulated and accessed within particular spaces and practices. Through these examples, we demonstrate the potential for social network analysis to enrich the research programs and support the goals of North American historical archaeologists and to link such research into broader themes across the social and humanistic sciences. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Archaeology of enslavement,Indigenous political systems,Social networks,Southeastern United States,,,,,Holland-Lulewicz J.,Roberts Thompson A.D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The article argues that digital scholarship tools and methods enhanced active learning during the shift to all-remote instruction by allowing students to engage directly with digital tools for collecting, analysing, organising and presenting information from wherever they were. We discuss how active learning using these tools enabled students to participate more fully in their own learning process and construct their own forms of knowledge and understanding; and provided an effective way to keep students engaged at a time when the unexpected transition to online instruction created a sense of dislocation for many. For institutions returning to in-person instruction these methods can provide enhanced engagement in the traditional classroom setting, and offer increased flexibility for the delivery of future programs. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. ©, Anne Houston, Janna Avon, Charlotte Nunes, Angela Perkins.",digital humanities,digital scholarship,Distance learning,students,,,,,Avon J.,Houston A.,Nunes C.,Perkins A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both share an approach to explaining social phenomena based on the micro-level.

Through a survey of the most frequently used tools of computational text analysis and an overview of their uses to date across the social sciences and humanities, this article shows how such methods can provide economic and business historians tools to respond to and engage with the ‘narrative turn’ in economics while also building on and offering a macro-level corrective to the focus on narrative in history. © 2021 The Author(s).

I adapt the post-critical lens of Greg Ulmer and the institutional theories of Warren Beaty from comics studies to advocate for a shift of how we identify both games and scholarship. The result, hopefully, is not only a new tool for the analysis of games, but a functional definition of video games that allows this new tool a place within the form. This article begins with examples from some of the most popular games in the world that demonstrate that games can and do merge aesthetics and mechanics to convey either implicit learning or an explicit argument in combination with entertainment. Next, I outline a theoretical framework of post-criticism for games, a perspective that helps us to understand the legitimacy of such an approach. A survey of the definitional debate in games studies and a brief outline of some of the problems therein contextualizes the value of an institutional approach to the question of “What is a game?” Finally, I explore how a post-critical framework and institutional definition of games provides a fresh outlook that incorporates a new medium into scholarship and defines games in a way that causes us to ask, “what makes this example interesting?” rather than “does it fit?. © 2021 The Author(s).

But the confirmation of Sci-Hub potentially working with Russian intelligence was major news. Both fronts of the Sci-Hub assault on stealing intellectual property are concerning. Since many academic researchers and their employers routinely receive defense contracts to perform sensitive research, the article helped posit that offering free access to academic research articles is perhaps a Trojan Horse strategy for Sci-Hub. To add to The Washington Post’s report, we sought out individuals at universities with a vantage point on Sci-Hub’s activities to see if there is independent evidence to support the report.

On the one hand, they help understand the construction of text. On the other hand, topics that are being considered sensitive at the time of the manuscript gain coherence and contextuality when taking alterations into account, especially in the case of deletions. The analysis of alterations in manuscripts, though, is a traditionally very tedious work. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based approach to help categorize alterations in documents. In particular, we present a new probabilistic model (Alteration Latent Dirichlet Allocation, alterLDA in the following) that categorizes content-related alterations. The method proposed here is developed based on experiments carried out on the digital scholarly edition Berlin Intellectuals, for which alterLDA achieves high performance in the recognition of alterations on labelled data. On unlabelled data, applying alterLDA leads to interesting new insights into the alteration behavior of authors, editors and other manuscript contributors, as well as insights into sensitive topics in the correspondence of Berlin intellectuals around 1800. In addition to the findings based on the digital scholarly edition Berlin Intellectuals, we present a general framework for the analysis of text genesis that can be used in the context of other digital resources representing document variants. To that end, we present in detail the methodological steps that are to be followed in order to achieve such results, giving thereby a prime example of a Machine Learning application in the Digital Humanities. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Landmark projects over the past century introduced various classification systems and initiated important debates within the field. From the author’s perspective, classification of data is understood as a necessary precursor to computation in these projects. Classificatory thinking is used here as a theme to explore debates that have arisen when abstractions of musical practice have been suggested for use with ethnomusicology. The paper proposes that a recent approach to research practice for embedding computation adds to ongoing interdisciplinary work, demonstrating novel ways of contextualizing archival materials with ethnography alongside computation. The approach attempted to strike a balance for engaging large amounts of data in ethnomusicology. The paper argues that some resulting tensions arising from classification lead to insights, which cannot be drawn by ethnomusicological methods alone. © 2021 The Author(s).

The authors focus on humanities data and its visualization, through analysis of their own recent projects with museums, archives and libraries internationally. Their account connects the specifics of hands-on digital humanities work to larger epistemological questions. They discuss the sources of potential mistrust, and examine how different expectations and assumptions emerge depending on the use and user of the data; they offer a simple schema through which the implications may be traced. It is argued that vital issues of trust can be engaged with through design, which, rather than being conceived as a cosmetic finish, is seen as contributing insights and questions that affect the whole process. The article concludes with recommendations intended to be useful in both theory and practice. © 2021 The Author(s).

Hearing change in the chocolate city: Computational methods for listening to gentrification,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117048327&partnerID=40&md5=7da9c5baa81236d193e9ff87cd4e53bd,"In this article, I outline a method of combining ethnography and computational soundscape analysis in order to listen to processes of gentrification in Washington, DC. I utilize Kaleidoscope Pro, a software suite built to visualize and cluster bioacoustic recordings (typically birds and bats) to cluster points of tension in the soundscape of Shaw, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood in DC. Clustering and visualizing these sounds (which include car horns, sirens, public transportation, and music) makes audible the sonic markers of gentrification in Shaw. Furthermore, listening to gentrification is a call to engage with the sonic right to the city, histories of legislating sound, and sonorities of memory and nostalgia. This work contributes to the burgeoning black digital humanities canon by thinking through how computational methods can help us to hear black life. Although the digital humanities have turned to embrace the sonic in recent years, there is still much to be done in considering how to embrace the aural in DH work. This project invites us to listen closely to a changing neighborhood, and emphasizes sound as a valid mode of knowledge production, questioning how a sonic rendering of gentrifying space through the digital might move us toward more equitable soundscapes. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Comparative k-pop choreography analysis through deep-learning pose estimation across a large video corpus,1,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117043628&partnerID=40&md5=c3228093300bd9df7ab629a5cb641650,"The recent advent of deep learning-based pose detection methods that can reliably detect human body/limb positions from video frames, together with the online availability of massive digital video corpora, gives digital humanities researchers the ability to conduct “distant viewing” analyses of movement and particularly full-body choreography at much larger scales than previously feasible. These developments make possible innovative, revelatory digital cultural analytics work across many sources, from historical footage to contemporary images. They are also ideally suited to provide novel insight to the study of K-pop choreography. As a specifically non-textual modality, K-pop dance performances, particularly those of corporate and government-sponsored “idol” groups, are a key component of K-pop’s core mission of projecting “soft power” into the international sphere. A related consequence of this strategy is the ready availability in online video repositories of many K-pop music videos, starting from the milieu's origins in the 1990s, including an ever-growing collection of official “dance practice” videos and fan-contributed dance cover videos and supercuts from live performances. These latter videos are a direct consequence of the online propagation of the “Korean wave” by generations of tech-savvy fans on social media platforms. In this paper, we describe the considerations and choices made in the process of applying deep learning-based posed detection to a large corpus of K-pop music videos, and present the analytical methods we developed while focusing on a smaller subset of dance practice videos. A guiding principle for these efforts was to adopt techniques for characterizing, categorizing and comparing poses within and between videos, and for analyzing various qualities of motion as time-series data, that would be applicable to many kinds of movement choreography, rather than specific to K-pop dance. We conclude with case studies demonstrating how our methods contribute to the development of a typography of K-pop poses and sequences of poses (“moves”) that can facilitate a data-driven study of the constitutive interdependence of K-pop and other cultural genres. We also show how this work advances methods for “distant” analyses of dance performances and larger corpora, considering such criteria as repetitiveness and degree of synchronization, as well as more idiosyncratic measures such as the “tightness” of a group performance. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

What does a photograph sound like? Digital image sonification as synesthetic audiovisual digital humanities,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117024114&partnerID=40&md5=0146163d2c04a9e746f565b843031e94,"Computers have the capacity to transpose the pixels, shapes, and other features of visual material into sound. This act of data correlation between the visual and the audial produces a new artifact, a sonic composition created from the visual source. The new artifact, however, correlates precisely to data in the original, thus allowing for fresh ways of perceiving its form, content, and context. Seeming to distort the visual object into an aural one paradoxically allows an observer to observe the visual evidence anew, with more accuracy. A kind of generative, synesthetic criticism becomes possible by cutting across typical boundaries between the visual and the audio, the optic and the aural. Listening to as well as looking at visual artifacts by way of digital transpositions of data enables better close readings, more compelling interpretations, and deeper contextual understandings. Building on my earlier scholarship into image glitching, remixing, and sonification, this essay investigates a photograph of Joan Baez performing at the Greek Amphitheater in Berkeley, California, during the early 1960s. The image comes from my project on the Berkeley Folk Music Festival and the history of the folk music revival on the West Coast of the United States. Here, the use of digital image sonification becomes particularly intriguing. While we cannot magically recover the music being made in the photograph, we can more closely attend to the ghosts of sound within the silent snapshot. Digital image sonification does not recover the music itself, but it does help to amplify issues of gender, power, embodiment, spectacle, performance, hierarchy, and performance in my perceptions of Baez making music in the photograph. Using the ear as well as the eye to scan the image for its multiple levels of meaning leads to unsuspected perceptions, which then support more revealing analysis. In digital image sonification, a cyborgian dance of data, signal, image, sound, history, and human perception emerges, activating visual materials for renewed scrutiny. In doing so, this mode of AudioVisual DH activates the scholarly imagination in promising new ways. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Using an advanced text index structure for corpus exploration in digital humanities,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116999716&partnerID=40&md5=45e28ee678d4a3b14c33189b573ddc41,"With suitable index structures many corpus exploration tasks can be solved in an efficient way without rescanning the text repository in an online manner. In this paper we show that symmetric compacted directed acyclic word graphs (SCDAWGs)-a refinement of suffix trees-offer an ideal basis for corpus exploration, helping to answer many of the questions raised in DH research in an elegant way. From a simplified point of view, the advantages of SCDAWGs rely on two properties. First, needing linear computation time, the index offers a joint view on the similarities (in terms of common substrings) and differences between all text. Second, structural regularities of the index help to mine interesting portions of texts (such as phrases and concept names) and their relationship in a language independent way without using prior linguistic knowledge. As a demonstration of the power of these principles we look at text alignment, text reuse in distinct texts or between distinct authors, automated detection of concepts, temporal distribution of phrases in diachronic corpora, and related problems. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Whether the creation, analysis, and sharing of audiovisual data or audiovisual ways of communicating scholarly knowledge, scholars are building compelling avenues of inquiry that are changing how we know, what we know, and why we know in the digital humanities (DH). These epistemological shifts not only challenge existing methodological and theoretical pathways within the field of audiovisual studies, but most importantly defy existing knowledge hierarchies within the entire field of DH. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Towards hermeneutic visualization in digital literary studies,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116566892&partnerID=40&md5=2fe6447efc7e5edcfdda0dc07dab97cc,"In this article, we present our reflections on hermeneutic data visualizations for digital literary studies. Hermeneutic approaches in the digital humanities have been rather agnostic about the epistemological premises of hermeneutic theory. These can be summarized as (1) differentiation author/text, (2) hermeneutic circle and (3) dependency text/recipient. In this article, we present the concept of hermeneutic visualization as a means of bridging the gap between “classic” literary hermeneutics and the emerging practice of digital literary hermeneutics. Since data visualization is based on epistemological premises stemming from the natural or social sciences, it is not well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. In this article, we argue that the digital humanities can meet hermeneutic demands through a critical interface and visualization concept. We discuss four postulates that can be used as guidelines and help transform “more traditional” data visualization into hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the epistemological foundations of hermeneutic theory. We demonstrate the usefulness of the postulates with an interactive prototype Stereoscope designed to support them.[1]. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Afrofuturist intellectual mixtapes: A classroom case study,1,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85116550767&partnerID=40&md5=5ab4782b86cf36169a229cc470a118a9,"This article is a classroom case study of the Intellectual Mixtape Project, an AudioVisual digital humanities module. The intellectual mixtape uses jazz and hip hop as a framework to create an audio compilation and “conversation” that samples literary-audio texts (such as SunRa speeches, Octavia Butler interviews, Tracy K. Smith’s poetry readings, etc.). Each track of the intellectual mixtape has three audios: 1) the literary-audio texts from the syllabus, 2) the students’ voice in their own words, and 3) an audio of the students’ choice. As a companion to each track, students write 500 words of liner notes that must include the title of their track and their curation and mixing decisions.Students then publish their entire intellectual mixtape (three or more tracks) with original or “remixed” cover art on an online platform. The first part of the study will discuss the structure of the intellectual mixtape assignments. In these assignments, students are provided with literary-audio texts, required to complete and submit audio homework assignments, and taught the basics of audio editing. This method of teaching and analyzing literature shifts the practice of literary analysis from top down approaches that privileges the authority of the text and instead encourages the student to “converse” with the text to create new knowledge. This methods also reflects the artistic practice of Afrofuturist artists and theorist who improvise, remix, and sample to create their work. The second part of the study will discuss a performance and midterm adaptation of the Intellectual Mixtape Project entitled Sound of Space: An Interactive Afrofuturist Experience. “Sound of Space” was an immersive performance with four-sensory stations that featured Afrofuturist themes. The midterm adaptation was showcased in the Cube, a four-story high, state-of-the-art multimedia black box theater at Virginia Tech. In preparation for the performance, students merged sound engineering, 360 degree-video-projection, improvisational performance, and light design. “Sound of Space” introduced students and audiences’ to an immersive Afrofuturist-audio experience and pushed the boundaries of literary analysis. The third part of the study will address challenges with the Intellectual Mixtape Project. Challenges include finding relevant literary-audio texts and dealing with the many limitations imposed by U.S. copyright law. Some ways to address the challenges imposed by U.S. copyright law might be to 1) reclassify sampling audio as a form of quotation, 2) use databases of copyright-free music, 3) find culturally significant works from lesser-known artists who will license their tracks, and/or 4) pay royalties. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Data visualization tools are one type of “middleware” that can be all but forgotten when one is presented with final products such as papers and presentations containing visualizations [Drucker and Svensson 2016]. Since the output of various software packages is sometimes similar, it is easy to forget the assumptions that went into the diagram, the dataset, and the software when looking at the final product — or even while using the tool if one becomes sufficiently accustomed to the interface. In this review, I revisit the visualization suite Palladio – which Miriam Posner has called a “Swiss Army knife for humanities data” [Posner 2014] – and the many projects that have made use of Palladio’s core features in the years since its launch. I examine the strengths and limitations of Palladio, as a network and map-making tool for exploring data and for rapidly prototyping diagrams, designed with an iterative process in mind. I contrast this iterative mentality with the analytic sensibility of tools like Gephi and Cytoscape, and review the primary features of Palladio with one primary case study (my own visualizations of the French Enlightenment network) and examples of how the features have been used in other digital humanities projects. Palladio is very useful for qualitative studies of data that include geospatial and chronological dimensions, especially when the data are tagged with different types of qualitative metadata, but it also tends to impose a historical geographical view on the data by foregrounding geospatial relationships, time, and other historical considerations. © 2021, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Audiobook reviews allow for a conversation between author and interviewer, whereby the author can place the work in a broader scholastic and contemporary context for listeners as well as actively engage with constructive critique and questions. The result is a dynamic scholarly communication rather than the static textual product of a book review. We discuss the unique role of audio technology within the knowledge production process from a performance studies and archival point of view.

Distant reading of literary language: Developing a methodology using quotations as an example,0,10.54013/kk764a4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115794896&doi=10.54013%2fkk764a4&partnerID=40&md5=45f48b2fb1875ba3d853a450fc5f4492,"This paper aims to take advantage of modern digital methods to address research topics that, until now, have mostly been subjects of assumption and interpretation based on rather few examples. More specifically, the purpose of this article is to explore some usage patterns of open quotation as a literary device and its impact on meaning. Open quotation, as defined by the French philosopher François Recanati, is a type of quotation where a string of words in an utterance is marked with quotation marks to imply the presence of multiple or deformed meanings. Alongside with other stylistic devices like parody, irony and pastiche, open quotation is regarded as a distinctive feature of postmodern literary language, yet it has not been empirically studied. One of the reasons may be the fact that it is difficult to obtain a systematic view of such textual features by means of traditional, i.e., close reading. However, the emergence of digital methods in humanities provide better access to such research problems. In literary studies, application of computational methods is associated with Franco Moretti’s approach of distant reading. However, distant reading does not offer a specific method to solve complex research problems in literary studies. Therefore, the second purpose of this study is to create a suitable methodology to best answer quotation-related research questions. In studies of Estonian culture, the emergence of postmodern aesthetics has been associated with the collapse of the Soviet system at the end of the 1980s. Therefore, the text corpus of this study consists of 50 Estonian novels published in 1990-2010. All cases of open quotation were extracted and divided into 8 categories based on qualitative features, and then explored in detail. Implying metalinguistic awareness was identified as the most important function of open quotation. Most commonly, it was used to reveal Soviet era related totalitarian ideologies, judgments and values inherent in language. Another interesting type of quotation previously undescribed in theoretical literature was distinguished: the category of pseudo-quotations aiming to illustrate both animate and inanimate objects by attributing to them an imaginary verbal act. In general, the use of open quotations reflects the decay of a monolithic value system by undermining the possibility of there being only one correct interpretation. Regarding methodology, computational methods proved to be effective in establishing high-level stylistic patterns. However, the patterns alone remained inconclusive, requiring qualitative analysis to reach meaningful conclusions. This suggests a fruitful way to approach complex research questions in humanities: first, a qualitative hypothesis is transformed into a specific quantitative method; secondly, the obtained results are interpreted qualitatively. © 2021, Foundation Kultuurileht.

Digital humanities in Estonia,0,10.54013/kk764a1,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115768991&doi=10.54013%2fkk764a1&partnerID=40&md5=1b7f299bdb6dee5d3c209239ed295695,"The article serves as a preface to the special issue on digital humanities of Keel ja Kirjandus. The aim of the issue is to familiarize the Estonian readers with the complex and controversial notion of digital humanities by way of examples. The issue gathers overviews of themes and methods in digital humanities along with empirical case studies representing them. We provide a brief discussion on what digital humanities is and why we need it. We consider that the core of digital humanities is the integration of digital data into humanities research. A growing amount of materials of interest to the humanities are now becoming digitized or digitally born. Archival institutions that maintain it have become recently active in facilitating their use for research purposes. Digital humanities can provide the methods, tools and the research community to take advantage of these opportunities. The digitalization of society is happening on many levels and humanities have a chance to contribute to its understanding and benefit from its opportunities. The label digital humanities itself can work as a pragmatic banner at this stage of development, potentially leading to digital skills becoming the norm also in the humanities departments at some point. The articles collected in this special issue give a good overview of the status quo of digital humanities in Estonia, representing various research directions and methods. The articles offer a variety of different perspectives and practical applications in their respective fields related to digital humanities. We believe that the area of digital humanities can advance via practical examples and an understanding of the developments of digital methods in neighbouring fields. We hope that further developments in this field will provide grounds for the compilation of other such thematic issues in the very near future. © 2021, Foundation Kultuurileht.

From digital humanities to cultural data analytics,0,10.54013/kk764a2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114998127&doi=10.54013%2fkk764a2&partnerID=40&md5=a186cb6ae23b42395c2afbd28a45a14d,"Digital Humanities (DH) has been a success story in the academic world over the last twenty years which has opened many new vistas in the humanities research. However, we argue that it is better to consider DH as a transitory phenomenon that needs to be developed into more specific research fields in order to overcome some fundamental shortcomings of DH. First, it is vital to transcend the division between qualitative inquiry into ideographic phenomena and quantification of nomothetic phenomena. This specifically includes the emergence and analysis of organized complexity, which emerges right in between. Secondly, it is important to surpass the dichotomy of singular and general as research objects and replace this by the notion of semiosphere as a research object, defined as the “smallest” functioning element of culture by Juri Lotman. From this perspective, the singular cultural unit is always conditioned by the whole of the semiosphere, but the whole can be always changed by the singular unit. Thirdly, the denominator “digital” is questionable and needs to be left behind, as there are many other forms of computation, which can be analog and/or digital. Indeed, alternative forms of non-digital computation are already see-ing a comeback. Fourthly, the label of “humanities” is at the same time too large and too restrictive. We would argue for a more specific study of meaning making practices in human society, yet without confining ourselves to traditional humanities scholarship but learning from the new developments in system biology, evolutionary economics, complexity science and many more. We propose to call this new trans-disciplinary field of study “cultural data analytics”, aiming to explore the dynamics of meaning making practices by computational means and looking at a spectrum of materials (textual, sonic, visual, multimodal, etc.) both regarding the longue durée and in real time, if not anticipating the future. © 2021, Foundation Kultuurileht.

This is partially due to their poorly monetisable subject matter, as well as the fact that their methodology is firmly rooted in the industrial era. The digital revolution provided the humanities with new technologies. However, the same newly available statistical methods that enable generalisation of a large bulk of materials and management of accurate data are fraught with serious limitations. Despite their ostensible novelty, the new methods cannot solve the epistemological problems of humanist learning; instead, they merely help its further adaptation to the inductive logic of scientific positivism, typical of the industrial era. This means that, given their digital nature (i. e., association with the digital era), they fail to generate a new ontology for the humanities. The value of new technologies is mainly determined by our ability to use them in an unconventional way. In order to preserve the subject matter of the humanities in its entirety, one should learn about the potential as well as limitations of digital methods and devise a positive strategy of their application. © 2021, G.

It traces the development of DH globally and considers the challenges in Oman, focusing on the state of digitalisation of the economy and knowledge through both public and private development. By exploring the possible immediate and far-reaching goals of a DH program in a country that requires drastic changes to meet the economic and social needs of its citizens and residents in a twenty-first century, post-Covid-19 economy, this study looks at the extent to which institutions are primed to build upon existing scaffolding to achieve digital goals. While focusing on pedagogical outcomes and strategies, this study suggests that DH is imperative to the effective implementation of the Omani national vision 2040 in terms of facilitating knowledge creation and nation-building through heritage preservation and that the establishment of a Digital Humanities Research Centre would be essential toward promoting interdisciplinary work in a sustained and effective manner. © 2021, Addleton Academic Publishers.

Enriched collections offer new opportunities for interface design to allow data-driven and visualisation-based search, exploration and interpretation. Most such interfaces integrate close and distant reading and represent semantic, spatial, social or temporal relations, but often lack contrastive views. Inspect and Compare (I&C) contributes to the current state of the art in interface design for historical newspapers with highly versatile side-by-side comparisons of query results and curated article sets based on metadata and semantic enrichments. I&C takes search queries and pre-curated article sets as inputs and allows comparisons based on the distributions of newspaper titles, publication dates and automatically generated enrichments, such as language, article types, topics and named entities. Contrastive views of such data reveal patterns, help humanities scholars to improve search strategies and to facilitate a critical assessment of the overall data quality.

Does transnational contention lead to transnational memory?

Commentators quickly described the worldwide protests as a manifestation of a new form of transnational contention, which would lead to new forms of transnational memory and identity. Building on efforts to connect social movement and memory studies, this article examines if the massive size and transnational nature of the February 2003 anti-war protests resulted in an equally widely shared and transnational form of memory. Following research that describes the crucial role of visual communication for social movements and memory, it approaches this question by studying the size and shape of the online visual memory of the 2003 anti-war protests. Applying the Google Cloud Vision API to retrieve and analyse 1746 online circulations of twenty-five photographs of the 2003 anti-war protests in the period 2003–2019, we find that, compared to other famous images of protest, the online circulation of images of the protests remains limited. This suggests that the massive protests of 2003 did not result in a widely shared and transnational form of memory. Rather than focusing on individual images, this article argues that studying patterns in their online circulation can explain why some movements remain in the public eye, while others quickly disappear from it. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anti-war movements,digital humanities,digital memory,Transnational contention,transnational memory,,,,Smits T.,Ros R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It highlights the relationships between the growing theoretical apparatus on how society changes with new digital technologies, and theories about how this might lead to new disabling barriers in the everyday lives of disabled people. To better understand disabled people’s everyday experiences of social exclusion in the digital age, it brings together insights from two different fields: digital technology, mainly in digital social science and digital humanities; and disability studies, with a focus on the digital divide. The study draws on empirical observations, photographs and interviews with adults with various disabilities in Sweden, and analyses their everyday experiences with the help of a theoretical framework. Points of interest To improve participation, it is critical to understand disabling barriers in a digital society. By bringing together digital technology and disability studies, it is possible to understand day-to-day contexts where there is potential for the digital divide to grow, especially for disabled people. Digital technologies designed for use in day-to-day life need to be more inclusive, and the barriers they create for individuals need to be understood before they are implemented. Digital technologies can construct disabling barriers in mundane contexts, even in some non-digital contexts where there is digital technology in the back-end, as for example, the internet of things. © 2021 The Author(s).

Text alignment algorithms provide domain experts with a robust alternative to such repetitive tasks. Existing white-box approaches allow the digital humanities to establish syntax-based metrics taking into account the spelling, morphology and order of words. However, they produce limited results, as semantic meanings are typically not taken into account. Our interdisciplinary collaboration between visualization and digital humanities combined a semi-supervised text alignment approach based on word embeddings that take not only syntactic but also semantic text features into account, thereby improving the overall quality of the alignment. In our collaboration, we developed different visual interfaces that communicate the word distribution in high-dimensional vector space generated by the underlying neural network for increased transparency, assessment of the tools reliability and overall improved hypothesis generation. We further offer visual means to enable the expert reader to feed domain knowledge into the system at multiple levels with the aim of improving both the product and the process of text alignment. This ultimately illustrates how visualization can engage with and augment complex modes of reading in the humanities.

Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e. differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the digital humanities.

This study aims to provide meaningful automatic labeling of fine art paintings (machine labeling) without the need for human annotation. A new unsupervised Adversarial Clustering System (ACS) is proposed. The ACS is an adversarial learning approach comprising an unsupervised clustering module generating machine labels and a supervised classification module classifying the data based on the machine labels. Both modules are linked through an optimization algorithm iteratively improving the unsupervised clusters. The objective function driving the improvement consists of the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) error and the supervised classification accuracy. The proposed method was tested on three different fine-art datasets, including two sets of paintings previously categorized by art experts and one never categorized collection of Australian Aboriginal paintings. The unsupervised clusters were analyzed using standard unsupervised clustering metrics and a reliability measure between machine and human labeling. The ACS showed higher reliability compared to the classical k-means clustering method. The content analysis of unsupervised clusters indicated grouping based on scene composition, type, and shape of the object, edge sharpness and direction, and color palette. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

But, even after some 70 years after the Partition, there has been no substantial study on the difference in the ontology of refugeehood across the two sites. More to it, narratives from the North-east (Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura), which again differ significantly from their western Indian or West Bengali counterparts, are under-represented in the existing database of oral narratives and ethnographies on the Partition. Departing from here, this paper engages in a critical comparative study—across three spatial axes: western India, West Bengal, and North-east India—of the third generation’s experience of “growing up refugee” in India. It offers a nuanced, but empirically-grounded, insight on how memories and narratives of the Partition are grounded in the linguistic registers of those who “grew up refugee” (not the refugees per se).

These include, at the most basic level, expressions of distance, orientation, and semantic/conceptual classifications. The second part of the paper addresses the problem of classifying regular expressive patterns through modeling: modeling is used as a strategy to better understand such linguistic-expressive phenomena, and as a hermeneutic exercise of application of computational methods to humanities data.

Understood as an ideology or ‘a set of abstract norms to which actual usage may conform to a greater or lesser extent’ (Milroy & Milroy 2012: 19), standardisation is core in the domain of normative linguistics, a field which has been concerned largely with codification and prescription, the last two stages of ‘the implementation of the standard’ as postulated by Milroy & Milroy (2012: 22–23). Codification is closely associated with the eighteenth century, and prescription naturally follows more intensely, though it is argued that it never comes to an end (Tieken 2008a: 10). Prescriptivism is yet a further stage in the pathway towards standardisation which develops ‘in full earnest’ in the nineteenth century (Tieken 2020a: 12), and not only are we entrenched in it but it is ‘resurgent’ as a ‘new prescriptivism’ (Beal 2009: 47). Where the rules that define standard and non-standard come from, what the nature of the prescriptions and proscriptions really is, and who codified the language, are all topics that have been addressed with a new focus since the early 1990s, both theoretically and methodologically. This article is concerned with the latter. It surveys the rich diversity of methodological approaches, old and new, to the study of codification, prescription, and prescriptivism in English. These methods are presented as seven thematic strands, and each strand will address the three main normative sources in this field of study: grammars, pronouncing dictionaries, and usage guides. It will be shown how new approaches have emerged over time, widening the scope of materials examined both in quantity and quality, and how the study of the normative tradition has greatly benefited from recent advances in corpus linguistics and the digital humanities, parallel to developments in other areas of linguistics. © 2021 Society for Studia Neophilologica.",grammars,Prescriptivism,pronouncing dictionaries,standardisation,usage guides,,,,Yáñez-Bouza N.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main objective of this work is to provide a reliable picture of Digital Humanities periodical academic publishing, with the focus on openness of its publications and its relationship with other dimensions, such as journal provenance, type of publisher, languages of publication, etc. and listing other characteristics such as publication visibility (DOAJ, SHERPA/RoMEO, and SCOPUS), years in publication, publication charges and embargo period. The study, carried out on a corpus of 38 selected journals of the discipline, reveals that Digital Humanities journals are mostly inclined to open access at its highest level. Only one of them does not allow any type of open access, while 7 of them are hybrid (green route if authors do not pay, gold route if they pay fees), one is gold open access and the remaining 29 are diamond open access. In other words, 76.3% of the journals in the corpus are platinum/diamond open access, at no cost to authors or readers. In them, publication costs are covered by grants, free software, voluntary work, etc. This study aims to visualize the position of publications in the field of Digital Humanities at a time when Open Science is revolutionizing the paradigm of scientific communication. © 2021.

[Methods] We used 25 Pre-Qin literature as training corpus, which covers the Confucian classics, history, philosophy and miscellaneous works. Then, we constructed a unified model with BERT for word segmentation and POS tagging without adding new features. Third, we examined our model with The Records of the Grand Historian, which was not included in the training corpus. Finally, we analyzed the four basic parts constituting historical events (names, locations, time, actions) with statistics and case studies. [Results] The proposed model’s F-score for word segmentation and the POS-tagging reached 95.98% and 88.97%. [Limitations] After analyzing the confusion heat map of POS tagging，it is found that the mislabeling，which is caused by the imbalanced part-of-speech distribution，the similar syntactic features of some parts of speech instances，and the multi-category words，needs further research and resolutions.

[Methods] First, we created a massive corpus of Chinese books from“Siku Quanshu”. Then, we studied the automatic sentence segmentation and punctuation as sequence labeling issues, and determined the cascaded ideas. Third, we obtained the results of automatic sentence segmentation for the uninterrupted sentences based on the BERT-LSTM-CRF model. Fourth, we processed these results with the multi-feature LSTM-CRF model and received the final punctuation marks after iterative learning. [Results] We built an application platform with the trained model and the Django framework. The average F values of the proposed method for automatic sentence segmentation and punctuation were 86.41% and 90.84%, respectively. [Limitations] The punctuation system needs to be refined.

They are published on the web in order to tell a story of a past event. Their emergence on the web, from 2005, is favored by the progress of the digital, the availability of open archives and corpora valorized in the context of digital humanities projects. As testimonies of “public uses of past”, they are likely to become an object for memory studies. Being produced outside of any institution, they are currently neither indexed nor preserved. The document description models (EAD, Dublin Core) are not adapted to these composite documents, whose textuality relies on the way their pre-existing documentary elements are structured. Based on examples, this paper proposes the principle and the primitives of a model for the description of these composite documents. The model relies on the characterization of the selection, the scheduling and the visualization of the documentary units composing the collection. We conclude that elaborating criteria for the formal analysis of the marks of authority of the sites is a main point by which to qualify their degree of reliability. This model aims to better understand these editorial forms in order to list them and to preserve their structure. © 2021, OpenEditions Journals.

Creative map studio: A platform for visual analytics of mental maps,1,10.26583/sv.13.2.06,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108946941&doi=10.26583%2fsv.13.2.06&partnerID=40&md5=daa13f82f7271981b3e4ffda8b9671b5,"This paper is devoted to the development of software tools, which allow to create and analyze mental maps in digital format. Mental maps are used to study humans’ cognitive characteristics and geospatial perception. To support Digital Humanities research based on the analysis of the mental maps, we developed a special high-level web-based vector graphics editor called Creative Maps Studio that allows informants to intuitively draw digital naive maps as a representation of their mental maps. The Creative Maps Studio web application provides a wide variety of drawing tools based on points, lines, and areas, which allow representing different objects on the map, such as cities, historical monuments, industrial facilities, state borders, roads, rivers, steppes, seas, swamps, etc. For each object, individual parameters can be set, such as color, size, transparency, name, description, emoticons, etc. Digital maps can be analyzed in various ways, relying on computer vision, machine learning, visualization, and manual expert analysis. Creative Maps Studio stores not only the final state of maps but also the entire history of user actions on the canvas, which makes it possible to consider the process of creating a map by the analysis. While Creative Maps Studio provides basic functions to view the informants’ maps and the history of their creation, we propose involving special software to achieve a comprehensive analysis of mental maps. In particular, we rely on the previously developed SciVi data mining platform and Semograph graph-semantic modeling information system. Creative Maps Studio provides appropriate export capabilities to transfer required data to these software systems. After exporting, the expert can use SciVi and Semograph to perform visual analytics of map objects’ properties, to handle maps’ textual layers, and to classify the maps on the principles of the fuzzy set theory. Thus, the mentioned software can be used to carry out the comprehensive study of informants’ spatial perception. In the future works, we plan to expand the set of objects available to draw the maps, allowing researchers to create custom ones, as well as to integrate analytics tools of maps creation history directly in the Creative Maps Studio. © 2021 National Research Nuclear University.

This paper examines the relevance of software studies for journalism studies in the context of automated news production, where technological artifacts can also be understood as being shaped by professional values and cultural practices. It also explores methods nourished by software studies’ theories to tackle news automation through a process-oriented approach. The cursor is placed on the materiality of the upstream components of automated news production: the data that feed the systems and the process that will make the news. Automated news production appears as a remixed editorial process nourished by previous editorial experiences that will be standardized through a some-how imitation game where technological and human mediation interplay.

This article builds on the results of sur-veys conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the United States and the United Kingdom, and compares them with a survey conducted in Europe. We found that European libraries are mostly active in research supporting activities, such as digitisation and storage, while US libraries often include analysis in their activities. Funding comes from the library’s main budget and non-structural funding in a variety of forms. Staff working in DH roles has a diverse range of titles, with various forms of librarians being the most used. Analytical staff such as GIS specialists are only found in the US survey. All surveyed libraries agree that the biggest skill gap amongst their staff is in technical skills. When looking towards the future, European libraries see the role of digital humanities (or digital scholarship) within the library grow and are making plans to facilitate this change within their organisation by positioning themselves as an attractive research partner, by opening and increasing their digital collections and by improving the inter-nal workings of the library. © 2021, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

To address that question, I embrace a makeshift, hybrid methodology, informed by theory, sociology, arts criticism, and the digital humanities, and eschewing media theoretical orthodoxies that have been dominant across the humanities (namely: an exaggerated emphasis on the “medium” at the expense of the “message”). From this polyglot perspective, I analyze content contained in a database that I have compiled, indexing 205,147 of the most-shared pieces of viral media on sites like Facebook and Twitter, from 2014 to 2019. After surveying this content’s basic features, I focus on one, particularly popular and quintessential content genre, which I call the “uplifting anecdote”: a short, sentimental account of a heroic act. The uplifting anecdote, I argue, promotes a novel type of ethics, ideally suited to the content economy. I then track this ethics’ dissemination into the broader culture, through a discussion of two prominent, aesthetic artifacts: George Saunders’ prize-winning, best-selling novel, Lincoln in the Bardo (2017), and NBC’s popular sitcom, The Good Place (2016-2020). © 2021, Department of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures, McGill University.

The study crosses disciplinary boundaries by bringing together linguistics and journalism studies. More specifically, it examines reporting about “Australia Day”—the official national day of Australia, which is set on a date that is becoming increasingly controversial, as it marks the beginning of colonisation. Importantly, the article utilises digital technologies (computer-based text analysis and visualisation of word co-occurrence) to apply and test these methods for the analysis of news values in English-language reporting. The study findings will thus have broader implications for journalism research. These methods (e.g., word frequency, collocation, concordancing) have been used in corpus linguistics and other areas of the digital humanities, including in the analysis of journalistic texts, but most often with a focus on language practices or discourses. Our study demonstrates that journalism research can profit from the use of free and user-friendly tools such as the ones that are applied in this study.

After defining DH and its relationship with academic librarianship, the difference between service and collaborative models is discussed.

Findings of this review indicate that there are, indeed, roles for librarians in the DH that can contribute to scholarly partnerships. These roles build on the shared values of librarianship and the humanities and are related to the critical and theoretical foundations of the DH. Critical librarianship provides a framework for roles that can contribute to knowledge production, not just to service provision. This framework can also work towards increasing representation and accessibility in DH scholarship. © 2021 Emilia C.

As such, future historical research will increasingly include digital forms of evidence and computer-based research tools. This article explores how such resources might be used within business history, bridging the gap to digital history, and reflecting upon their methodological implications. We present a framework for distinguishing between sources, elaborating their differing digital characteristics and historical authenticity.

Historical maps contain valuable information about historical, geographical and economic aspects of an era. Retrieving information from historical maps is more challenging than processing modern maps due to lower image quality, degradation of documents and the massive amount of non-annotated digital map archives. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) solved many image processing challenges with great success, but they require a vast amount of annotated data. For historical maps, this means an unprecedented scale of manual data entry and annotation. In this study, we first manually annotated the Third Military Mapping Survey of Austria-Hungary historical map series conducted between 1884 and 1918 and made them publicly accessible. We recognized different road types and their pixel-wise positions automatically by using a CNN architecture and achieved promising results. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional neural networks,digital humanities,digital preservation,document analysis,geospatial analysis,geospatial artificial intelligence,image processing,road type detection,Can Y.S.,Gerrits P.J.,Kabadayi M.E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We test James Thompson’s claim that “inheritance is enabling or authorizing for male protagonists and disabling for female protagonists” using computational analysis of a corpus of twenty-nine novels and combine our results with close reading of the novels from our corpus. We found that the representation of heiresses’ and heirs’ agency varies according to genre. Heiresses had more agency than expected, this was especially the case for heiresses in gothic fiction. We noticed a decline in the agency of male heirs in the nineteenth century compared with the eighteenth century, while the agency of other character types such as unmoneyed characters appears to increase. © 2021 by The Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University.

In this paper, we explore two alternative algorithmic approaches tailored to different applications scenarios. The first approach, Rantanplan, is a rule-based method that consists of four Natural Language Processing modules that work together to perform scansion and other related analysis: Part of Speech tagging, syllabification, stress assignment, and metrical adjustment. The second approach, Jumper, explores the possibility of performing scansion without syllabification, with a twofold purpose: to minimize the errors propagated in different parts of the linguistic processing pipeline (including the syllabification step), and to improve the efficiency of the process. Both systems outperform the state of the art and provide either a more informative solution (suitable, for instance, for teaching purposes) or a more efficient processing (when a correct scansion is all the linguistic knowledge required, as in scholar philological studies). The combined use of both systems turns out to provide a practical tool to clean-up manual annotation errors in corpora. © 2013 IEEE.",automated metric analysis,corpus annotation,digital humanities,Natural language processing,poetry,scansion,Spanish,,Marco G.,De La Rosa J.,Gonzalo J.,Ros S.,Gonzalez-Blanco E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The author completed her academic career as Professor of Digital Humanities (DH) at the University of Brighton, UK. In terms of approach, she looks back over 25 years of working in this domain, which she entered as a scientist in contrast to most of the other academics at that time who came from the humanities. She delineates her academic journey that passed through various disciplines/fields. Findings: The author reflects upon her entire career, starting with decisions made at school, to see how they have affected her contribution to DH. She concludes that a deep understanding of technological issues is fundamental to making sense of such complex fields as Big Data and its effect on humanities research in particular and society in general. She also draws attention to the loss of several highly technical, specialised and practical DH teams, which were replaced with ones whose focus is on DH discourse.

Communication and media history has not yet reacted much to the challenge of the increasing availability of historical sources as data, digital corpora and digitized objects, and remains in large parts in an early stage of approaching digital research perspectives. From an epistemological position, the aim of the paper is to stimulate and motivate more intensive reflection on the methodology and methods of historical research in digital contexts, as well as their consequences for the practice of methods in communication and media history: What actually happens to research practice when research software is now to be employed and used for questions and problems in communication and media history? How does this irritate and shift ingrained research practices and routines? A suggestion for the methodological foundation of innovative research in communication and media history is developed, which operates at the interface of digital technologies and software and shapes its sociotechnical arrangement as well as its complex epistemological conditions and implications according to the professional needs, expectations and cognitive interests as well as critically questions and reflects them. © 2021, Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH und Co.

In this paper, we present text mining methodologies from digital humanities that can be applied to large corpora of archaeological texts to trace and evaluate changing knowledge practices. Such a big data approach is imperative. Due to the rapid increase of archaeological publications, qualitative research into the intellectual history of archaeology has become complicated and highly selective. The big data methods presented in this study were tested on a large corpus (4,811 texts totaling over 51 million words) of different types of archaeological texts from the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. The different text mining tools were successful in identifying theoretical trends. Our tools were also successful in charting the decrease in quality due to changed organizational circumstances (developer-led archaeology).

However, while this is a necessary output, discussion around the processes and workflows required to turn collections into data, and to make collections data available openly, are just as valuable. With libraries increasingly becoming producers of their own collections – presenting data from digitisation and digital production tools as part of datasets, for example – and making collections available at scale through mass-digitisation programmes, the trustworthiness of our processes comes into question. In a world of big data, often of unclear origins, how can libraries be transparent about the ways in which collections are turned into data, how do we ensure that biases in our collections are recognised and not amplified, and how do we make these datasets available openly for reuse? This paper presents a case study of work underway at the National Library of Scotland to present collections as data in an open and transparent way – from establishing a new Digital Scholarship Service, to workflows and online presentation of datasets. It considers the changes to existing processes needed to produce the Data Foundry, the National Library of Scotland’s open data delivery platform, and explores the practical challenges of presenting collections as data online in an open, transparent and coherent manner. © 2021, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

[Coverage] We used various sources such as SSCI, SCIE, EI, A&HCI, CPCI-S, CPCI-SSH, Google Scholar, CNKI, Wanfang Data and VIP to search literatures with the keywords“cultural heritage crowdsourcing”,“crowdsourcing AND digital humanities”,“cultural heritage AND collaboration”,“cultural heritage AND user generated content”,“GLAM AND crowdsourcing”etc. We then collected 110 representative literatures in conjunction with topic screening and backward and forward approach. [Methods] First, we classified the connotation and extension of cultural heritage crowdsourcing and made a loosely defined concept. Then, we investigated the current status of research and practice of cultural heritage crowdsourcing from three key elements of data resources, digital technology and platform system. [Results] This paper explores the concept of cultural heritage crowdsourcing, proposes the classification of cultural heritage crowdsourcing projects, explores the data life cycle and digital technology classification system of cultural heritage crowdsourcing, and sorts out the relevant research results and experience in the construction and operation management of cultural heritage crowdsourcing platform. [Limitations] Future research will further refine the integrated framework of the cultural heritage crowdsourcing model for the research and practice of digital humanities. [Conclusions] Cultural heritage crowdsourcing is a new model in the field of public cultural services in recent years in terms of data collection and analysis, construction of information resources and innovation of knowledge services. It is a new campaign in response to the deep integration of technology and culture in the digital era, and also a new direction for digital humanities exploration in the discipline of library, information and archives management. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The proof has three main components: (1) computer artificial intelligences (including machine-learning algorithms) run on the CPU’s Arithmetic Logic Unit, which performs all of its computations using symbolic logic; (2) symbolic logic is incapable of causal reasoning; and (3) causal reasoning is required for processing the narrative components of literature, including plot, character, style, and voice. This proof is presented both in logical form and as a narrative. The narrative’s beginning traces the origin of automated symbolic-logic literature processors back before modern computing to the 1930s Cambridge scholar I. A. Richards. The middle recounts how these processors became a basis of New Criticism, Cultural Poetics, and other twentieth- and twenty-first-century theories of literary “interpretation.” And the end explores how those theories’ preference for symbolic logic over causal reasoning leaves them vulnerable to the same blind spot that early modern scientists detected in medieval universities: the inability to explain why literature (or anything else) works—and therefore the inability to comprehend how to use it.

However, elsewhere such as China Mainland, little interest is yet visible in this scholarship. Still controversial over its methodology and epistemology, and too early to predict its future, digital humanities scholars have made respectful and encouraging commitments and accomplishments. The self-protection of humanities from further marginalization, through intersection with and integration of techno-humanities, is in line with the well-established value of innovation and the ubiquitous needs of social improvement. From both a macro and micro perspective, the author of this article contends that digital humanities scholarship can contribute to the humanities as a whole, by expanding comparative literature studies with data-based empiricism. However, as a new approach to comparative literature, digital humanities is still in its fedgling stage and faces a slew of challenges: inadequate involvement from humanities scholars, undefined boundaries within humanities disciplines, lack of global recognition, and immature theoretical models to propel future research.

CRMtex was originally intended to detect the close relationship linking ancient texts with the physical objects on which they are supported, the tools and writing systems used for their production, and the various scientific investigations and readings carried out on the text by modern scholars. It eventually evolved to provide researchers with the fundamental concepts for the correct and complete rendering of textual objects, the events representing their history and the cultural and social environments in and for which they were created. The full compatibility of CRMtex with the CIDOC CRM ontology and its extensions ensures persistent interoperability of data encoded by means of its entities with other semantic information produced in cultural heritage and digital humanities. The new entities presented in this paper deal more closely with textual and intertextual structures and try to deepen the close relationships existing between fragments of text or sequences of signs and the underlying meaning they were originally intended to convey. © 2021 - IOS Press.

WarSampo knowledge graph: Finland in the Second World War as Linked Open Data,13,10.3233/SW-200392,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100295902&doi=10.3233%2fSW-200392&partnerID=40&md5=5c047e6fce03c76cfbbb4ee20729adbe,"The Second World War (WW2) is arguably the most devastating catastrophe of human history, a topic of great interest to not only researchers but the general public. However, data about the Second World War is heterogeneous and distributed in various organizations and countries making it hard to utilize. In order to create aggregated global views of the war, a shared ontology and data infrastructure is needed to harmonize information in various data silos. This makes it possible to share data between publishers and application developers, to support data analysis in Digital Humanities research, and to develop data-driven intelligent applications. As a first step towards these goals, this article presents the WarSampo knowledge graph (KG), a shared semantic infrastructure, and a Linked Open Data (LOD) service for publishing data about WW2, with a focus on Finnish military history. The shared semantic infrastructure is based on the idea of representing war as a spatio-temporal sequence of events that soldiers, military units, and other actors participate in. The used metadata schema is an extension of CIDOC CRM, supplemented by various military history domain ontologies. With an infrastructure containing shared ontologies, maintaining the interlinked data brings upon new challenges, as one change in an ontology can propagate across several datasets that use it. To support sustainability, a repeatable automatic data transformation and linking pipeline has been created for rebuilding the whole WarSampo KG from the individual source datasets. The WarSampo KG is hosted on a data service based on W3C Semantic Web standards and best practices, including content negotiation, SPARQL API, download, automatic documentation, and other services supporting the reuse of the data. The WarSampo KG, a part of the international LOD Cloud and totalling ca. 14 million triples, is in use in nine end-user application views of the WarSampo portal, which has had over 690 000 end users since its opening in 2015. © 2021 - IOS Press.

Utilizing the most comprehensive data on the parliament–the Journal of the House of Commons– and, through computer programming and database manipulation, integrating it with what is known of individual Members of Parliament (MPs), it explores the reactions of parliament-men en masse and by a number of demographic categories to some of the most important issues of James’s early reign: finance, religion, prerogative against privilege, the grievances of impositions, purveyance and wardship, and the Anglo-Scottish Union. In doing so, it shines new light on some of the biggest questions asked by historiography: who were the parliament-men of the first Jacobean Parliament, did they act in predictable ways, and can any of them be considered to represent some form–religious, ‘country’ or cultural–of ‘opposition’? Not only does it suggest some startling conclusions, reopening old debates with new insights, but it also provides another approach to our understanding of the crisis of the mid-seventeenth century, and to the history of parliaments as a whole. © 2021 International Commission for the History of Representative and Parliamentary Institutions/Commission Internationale pour l’Histoire des Assemblées d’ États.",1604 parliament,demography,digital humanities,England,House of Commons,James I,,,Kilroy D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A character social network relationship map tool to facilitate digital humanities research,2,10.1108/LHT-08-2020-0194,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099550552&doi=10.1108%2fLHT-08-2020-0194&partnerID=40&md5=521332058c388bfb1aa7b5710986cb4d,"Purpose: Digital humanities aim to use a digital-based revolutionary new way to carry out enhanced forms of humanities research more effectively and efficiently. This study develops a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) that can semi-automatically assist digital humanists through human-computer interaction to more efficiently and accurately explore the character social network relationships from Chinese ancient texts for useful research findings. Design/methodology/approach: With a counterbalanced design, semi-structured in-depth interview, and lag sequential analysis, a total of 21 research subjects participated in an experiment to examine the system effectiveness and technology acceptance of adopting the ancient book digital humanities research platform with and without the CSNRMT to interpret the characters and character social network relationships. Findings: The experimental results reveal that the experimental group with the CSNRMT support appears higher system effectiveness on the interpretation of characters and character social network relationships than the control group without the CSNRMT, but does not achieve a statistically significant difference. Encouragingly, the experimental group with the CSNRMT support presents remarkably higher technology acceptance than the control group without the CSNRMT. Furthermore, use behaviors analyzed by lag sequential analysis reveal that the CSNRMT could assist digital humanists in the interpretation of character social network relationships. The results of the interview present positive opinions on the integration of system interface, smoothness of operation, and external search function. Research limitations/implications: Currently, the system effectiveness of exploring the character social network relationships from texts for useful research findings by using the CSNRMT developed in this study will be significantly affected by the accuracy of recognizing character names and character social network relationships from Chinese ancient texts. The developed CSNRMT will be more practical when the offered information about character names and character social network relationships is more accurate and broad. Practical implications: This study develops an ancient book digital humanities research platform with an emerging CSNRMT that provides an easy-to-use real-time interaction interface to semi-automatically support digital humanists to perform digital humanities research with the need of exploring character social network relationships. Originality/value: At present, a real-time social network analysis tool to provide a friendly interaction interface and effectively assist digital humanists in the digital humanities research with character social networks analysis is still lacked. This study thus presents the CSNRMT that can semi-automatically identify character names from Chinese ancient texts and provide an easy-to-use real-time interaction interface for supporting digital humanities research so that digital humanists could more efficiently and accurately establish character social network relationships from the analyzed texts to explore complicated character social networks relationship and find out useful research findings. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Character name recognition,Chinese ancient book,Digital humanities,Human-computer interaction,Information visualization,Social networks analysis,,,Chen C.-M.,Chang C.,Chen Y.-T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under various banners–historical GIS, qualitative and mixed methods GIS, spatial and digital history, digital humanities, spatial humanities or geohumanities–researchers have developed new ways to include qualitative data within the framework of GIS. At the same time, social and theoretical critiques of GIS as a tool wielded chiefly by and for those in power have increased awareness of its limitations, particularly for studying human perceptions, experiences, and the meanings of place. We agree with a growing chorus of geographers that the most common data structures in GIS are inadequate to capture or analyze the relational dimensions of subjectivity. As part of the solution, we propose an alternative hybrid framework that prioritizes topological relationships while retaining coordinate locations as points of connection between geographic places and experiential evidence. This article explains how the challenges posed by Holocaust survivor testimony inspired us to pursue inductive spatial analysis and non-coordinate means of mapping. We then set out a model for a topological GIS and illustrate its application with two survivor testimonies and a map of their experiences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Holocaust,mapping experience,Topological GIS,,,,,,Westerveld L.,Knowles A.K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a way to scientifically model the analysis of digital texts using digital methods. Computer science comes in support of linguistic skills in order to deal with investigative situations and help analyze criminal acts. It presents a case report thanks to the analysis of a corpus made up of 23 texts relating to criminal acts related to suspected terrorist groups with links to the far left. The goal is to help investigators by providing results which can help find stylistic similarities or exclusions between texts and thus potentially between the authors of those texts, offering authors profiling hypothsesis that may be included in the investigation process. While linguistics alone cannot solve such cases, a better understanding of language data, including topics, style and grammar, bring additional clues that can be very useful information in the investigation of crimes (linguists can “translate” information to investigators, so that it can be integrated to the investigation). Digital tools provide a form of objectification since they are based on statistical calculations which reveal regularities that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. These tools, when used properly in investigations, can prove invaluable in extracting “clues” from the linguistic “traces” that make up texts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Corpus,Forensic linguistics,Linguistics,Stylometry,Textometry,,,,Longhi J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a corpus gathered from a systematic search on the Web, we trace the multiple forms of engagement between academic and commercial communities, echoed but also shaped by reports in traditional and new media. We find that neuromarketing developed an identity through a set of practices and a series of debates which involved intertwined communities of academic researchers and practitioners.

The regularity of the meetings, and the mixtures of gender, social groups and nationalities are mostly mentioned as the defining characteristics of a salon. Since these have a quantitative fundament it is surprising that most scholars only use qualitative methods. Analysing the receptions of the Italian countess Ersilia Caetani-Lovatelli, this article shows the value of quantitative research. It helps disproving old historiographical assumptions that are mostly related to the social composition and functioning of the gatherings. It also leads to a plea for using of the alternative concept of private sociability. © 2018 The Author(s).

DPN is an informal interdisciplinary training network formed to foster the transfer of Digital Humanities (DH) knowledge and skills and to build connections between Simon Fraser University (SFU) and University of Victoria (UVic) faculty, students, librarians, educational partners, and the public. Central to the network has been the participation and experience of students, who have shared their digitally-focused work in a series of showcases and symposia that have alternated between SFU and UVic. What emerged during these events were student perspectives on current pedagogical practices in Digital Humanities, both inside and outside the classroom, as well as for the degree and beyond. Our special collection builds on these perspectives, featuring student authors addressing issues that over the past five years have been central to their DH learning and training. These student perspectives gather into four topic clusters, namely 1) Collaboration with Galleries, Libraries, Archives, & Museums (GLAM); 2) Digital Doctorates; 3) Major Research Projects; and 4) Transforming DH Pedagogy.

"Deference to paper: Textuality, materiality, and literary digital humanities in Africa",1,10.16995/DSCN.357,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099982196&doi=10.16995%2fDSCN.357&partnerID=40&md5=8f975ea49471dda1a37e5a4b6e17f6d4,"This article explores the relationship between the forms of representation and the modes of production of African online writing, rendering visible an appreciation of the digital contexts that have occasioned new experimentations with regard to genre, style and the formation of digital publics. But it's the bibliographic form and materiality of African digital texts that interest me the most. The medium of African literature, profoundly transformed since the arrival of the Internet, conditions the transmission, reception of meaning and the constitution of reading publics and the identity of audiences. More so, the new textual environment of African writing and creatives expressions such as digital networks and literary blogs are terrains of discursive contestations that activate these digital fields of cultural production in Africa as materially connected to prior literary forms. Deploying several examples, including the recent 'transition' of Saraba Magazine to print and Mike Maphoto's Diary of a Zulu Girl, I argue that, despite the widespread uses of digital media forms in new African narratives, there is a lingering print imaginary in the digital articulations of African literary texts. While this tension between print and digital forms shapes textual meanings, it signals new directions in African literary studies more broadly.

Topic analysis of estonian runosongs: Prospects and challenges,0,10.7592/methis.v21i26.16914,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122323833&doi=10.7592%2fmethis.v21i26.16914&partnerID=40&md5=caca47f0451c84ae71efd3c5fa4fae66,"The article explores possibilities of computational topic analysis of Estonian runosong texts using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling. Runosong is an oral poetic tradition known among most of Finnic peoples. Estonian runosong texts, the material of the current research, have been collected mainly since 1880s and gathered into the Estonian Folklore Archives of the Estonian Literary Museum, where the runosong database with more than 100 000 texts has been compiled (Oras et al 2003–2020) Language of runosongs varies considerably across dialects and, in addition to that, it uses a specific archaic idiom different from the spoken language which complicates the computational analysis of the content aspects of the texts. Topic modelling is a method that enables to discover abstract topics detected statistically on the basis of the frequency of the co-occurrence of the words in the texts. In case of a runosong corpus, the method could be used to automatically detect the thematic structure of a large amount of runosong texts, to compare the thematic distribution of regional traditions of the runosong, and to analyse how the thematic distribution obtained with the help of computational methods relates to the classification of the texts resulting from folkloristic analysis. The idea of the current article is to explore whether topic modelling can give meaningful results if applied to unlemmatized and highly variative runosong texts. For LDA topic modelling I used the application MALLET (McCallum 2002). The initial trials with the whole corpus of runosong texts made it clear that the language of the songs is too variative to reach the level of content. It also became obvious that it is necessary to remove stopwords and refrain words. The topics, obtained from the runosongs from all over Estonia, represented dialectal variants of the language rather than thematic clusters and it was necessary to restrict the material. I used stylometric analysis (using R package stylo, Eder et al 2013) to divide the area into linguistically more homogenous subregions, and chose the area of Western islands of Estonia with 16 parishes and 3672 song texts for further explorations.With this material I decided to generate 20 topics. Within this smaller area the topics did not cluster regional language variants any more: (1) the linguistic variants of the main concepts of a topic were brought together under the keywords of the same topic; (2) in most cases, the detected topics were distributed among all the parishes included in the selection. Looking at the 20 keywords, the topics indeed seemed to reflect certain thematic subgroups of the songs. In several cases the most prominent song type of a topic was reflected in keywords, in other cases the keywords referred to larger groups of songs. Five of the 20 topics focused on weddings, more precisely, on different episodes of the wedding ritual: Adornation and dressing, arriving and greeting, finding the bride and taking her to her new home, sharing the presents prepared by the bride, and recommendations to the bride and the groom. In all these topics the verbs refer either to the present or the future (rather than to the past which is common in narrative songs). A topic of swinging songs includes also the songs about dancing and feasts. Five topics focus on different narrative plots about the troubles of young people, about wooing and marriage. Lyric songs about the life of orphans and about singing form a separate topic each, and there is a separate male topic covering the songs of various genres related to horses, riding and the woods. The largest topic includes the songs on working at home and outside, but also the songs about premarital sex. There are two topics with the focus on well-known children’s songs and lullabies. Two topics relate to German landlords, their power and activities, and one to recruiting and the war. As a conclusion of this exploration: (1) for topic modelling it is necessary to use the texts in homogenous language variants; otherwise, the linguistic differences override the topics at some point; (2) it is possible to use unlemmatized texts for topic modelling, but in this case the grammatical features (tense, modality) interfere with topic analysis; (3) the proportions of variable and stable (recurrent) elements (song types, motifs) in the material have a clear impact on topic formation: The more frequently an element occurs in the material, and the more stable is its wording, the bigger its probability to form the centre of a topic, whereas distinct but rare themes remain unnoticed and will be shared between the topics of more prominent subjects; (4) common sets of words assembled together as the topic may, in addition to the common thematic focus, refer to a common framework, for example environments, and behavioural or communicative patterns (for example, begging for something). Compared to the folkloristic classification of folk songs, the automatic distribution of songs (1) highlights the subjects occurring more frequently in the body of songs (for example, a topic highlights swinging songs instead of calendar songs of the folkloristic classification); (2) partly overrides the genre differences (for example song games can be found under different topics, whereas forming a distinct group in folkloristic classifications). © 2020, University of Tartu Press.

Digital literary heritage projects as a source of language resources: A case of estonian criticism in korp,0,10.7592/methis.v21i26.16916,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85122321274&doi=10.7592%2fmethis.v21i26.16916&partnerID=40&md5=2aaffd5210d015b2d7cd908e10fcefdf,"Estonia can soon expect an explosive growth in digital heritage and text resources due to the current pro­ject of mass digitisation of national cultural heritage (printed books, archival documents, photos, art, audiovisual, and ethnographic artifacts) (2019-2023). This will give new opportunities for different fields of digital humanities and make digitised heritage accessible to everyone in the form of open data. The project will focus on the usage of the heritage, on the needs of education, e-learning, and the creative industry, including digital creative arts. The aim of this article is to examine some research possibilities that opened up for literary history due to the digitisation of literary works and archival sources and to put them in the general context of digital humanities. Although the field of digital humanities is broad, the meaning of DH is often reduced to methods of computational language-centered analyses, mainly based on using different tools and software languages (R, Stylo, Phyton, Gephy, Top Modelling etc.). While the corpus-based research is already a professional standard in linguistics, literary scholars are still more used to working with traditional methods. This arti­cle introduces two digital literary history projects belonging to the field of digital humanities and analyses them as language resources for creating texts corpora, and introduces some results of the case study of Estonian criticism from the Young Estonia movement up to the 1920s, carried out using the literary texts corpora in the corpus query system KORP (https://korp.keeleressursid.ee) by the Centre of Estonian Lan­guage Resources. During the past twenty years, I have mainly focussed on developing large-scale implementation pro­jects for digital representation of Estonian literary history. The objective of these experimental projects has been to develop principally new non-linear models of Estonian literary history for the digital environment. These activities were based on my research in the intertextual relations between authors, literary works, and critical texts using traditional methods. The first content-based literary history project “ERNI. Estonian Literary History in Texts 1924-1925” (www2.kirmus.ee/erni) was based on a hypertextual network of literary source texts and reviews. We re­conceptualised literary history as a non-linear narrative and a gallery with many entrances. The task of the project was also to ensure its usability in education: A significant number of study materials has been added in cooperation with schoolteachers. In 2004, we initiated our long-term and still running project “Kreutzwald's Century: The Estonian Cul­tural History Web” (http://kreutzwald.kirmus.ee) at the Estonian Literary Museum. The objective of this project was to make literary sources of the period accessible as the dynamic, interactive information envi­ronment. This was a hybrid project which synthesised the classical study of Estonian literary history, the needs of the digital media user, and the expanding digital resources from different memory institutions; its underlying idea was to link together all the works of fiction of an author, as well as their biography, manu-cripts, and photos and to make them visible for the user on five interactive time axes. The project uses a specially created platform. Today, this platform is extensively used by schoolteachers: In 2020 (Jan.-Dec.) it had about 8, 986.555 clicks and during seven years (2013 Dec.-2020 Dec.) it has collected 64, 627.380 clicks. To find out how we can fit such content-based models of literary heritage into the context of Digital Humanities we need to compare the previous modelling practices with our current experimental project in the corpus query system KORP. Our interdisciplinary project “Literary Studies Meet Corpus Linguistics” (2017-2020) concentrated on studying literary history sources with linguistic methods. As the result of the project two literary text corpora were created: “Epistolary text corpus of Estonian writers Johannes Sem­per and Johannes Vares-Barbarus” and “Corpus of the Estonian literary criticism, Noor-Eesti and the 1920s”. Both of them were pilot projects in the field, started with converting the digitalised archival and printed sources into machine-readable format before text and data mining for corpus creation. Query system KORP allows us to organise the language data by all the categories used in the corpus, for example, to learn who and in what context mentioned the name of the French writer Andre Gide. The second currently running project is the morphologically annotated corpus of literary criticism. This corpus contains texts of literary reviews and criticism in different genres, drawn from the projects ERNI and “Kreutzwald's Century”. The first results in studying the dynamics of literary values can already be seen. A query in KORP about the word ‘moju’ (‘influence') revealed that the manifesto “More of European culture!”of the group Young Estonia, voiced in 1905, was during the independent Estonian Republic replaced by the valuing of a specific national character. Corpus query showed a change in the meaning of the word: In the criticism contemporary to Young Estonia, the word ‘moju’ was only associated with the historical pressure from Russian and German cultures. The foundation for modern comparative linguistics at the University of Tartu was laid in the 1920s by the professorship in Estonian literature. © 2020, University of Tartu Press.

Integrating computation into humanities education,2,10.7592/methis.v21i26.16909,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115799996&doi=10.7592%2fmethis.v21i26.16909&partnerID=40&md5=f3a382a97243a1e65e2d1b252e80a121,"Digital Humanities can be regarded as a complex landscape of partially overlapping and variously connected domains, including e.g. computational humanities, multimodal cultural heritage and digital cultural studies and cultural analytics (Svensson 2010). Yet, as a precondition for setting up an educational programme within an academic institution, one needs to be able to delineate the discipline being taught (Sinclair and Gouglas 2002, 168) in terms of a coherent academic identity, interrelations between courses, and skills that graduates will attain. Therefore any locally situated educational enterprise needs to focus on those areas of DH that can be reasonably tied to research conducted at the hosting institution. At the University of Helsinki, we have put particular effort into defining our educational profile in interdisciplinary computational humanities, taught both as a minor studies module (30 ECTS) and an MA track (120 ECTS). Because of the complexities of humanities data and the lack of standard protocols for dealing with it, it is very difficult for a humanities scholar to apply computational and statistical methods in a trustworthy manner without specialist help. At the same time, neither can computer scientists, statisticians or physicists answer humanities questions on their own, even if they understand the algorithms. Our solution to this problem is to argue that computational humanities research, and as a consequence also digital humanities education, should be fundamentally interdisciplinary endeavours, where statisticians, computer scientists and scholars in the humanities work together to develop, test and apply the methodology to solve humanities questions. Our version of computational humanities thus exists precisely and solely at the intersection of humanities and computer science rather than as separate from either of them. Consequently, people participating in this field should primarily anchor their academic profile to one of the parent disciplines instead of trying to find an identity purely in the middle. This is reflected in our educational approach. We provide students in the humanities with instruction on how to use ready-made tools, workflows or applied programming, granting them a general digital competency and agency, but our focus is on developing a broader literacy regarding data and computational methods. By learning to contextualize their skills within the field of computational humanities as a whole, the humanities students also learn to assess where their personal boundaries lie, and where an interdisciplinary collaboration is required instead. In this context, their computational literacy also helps them converse with the methodological experts coming to the field from computer science. In this interdisciplinary setting, we take a project-based approach to learning, tying teaching to actual research projects being conducted at the faculty. This approach both harnesses the varying competencies of our students and provides an excellent basis for learning interdisciplinary collaboration (Bell 2010). The culmination of our project courses is the Digital Humanities Hackathon, a multidisciplinary collaboration between the University of Helsinki digital humanities programme and the data science programmes at the Department of Computer Science and Aalto University. For researchers and students from computer and data sciences, the Hackathon is an opportunity to test their abstract knowledge against complex real-life problems; for people from the humanities and social sciences, it shows what is possible to achieve with such collaboration. For both, the Hackathon gives the experience of working with people from different backgrounds as part of an interdisciplinary team and simulates group work in such professional settings as the students may find themselves in after graduation, acculturating them to work outside academia (cf. Rockwell and Sinclair 2012). Our conception of computational humanities as intrinsically collaborative and interdisciplinary is based on the realisation that the traditional, single-author research culture of the humanities is a hindrance to successfully integrating computational approaches into humanities research. We feel that our formulation of the field has the power to contribute to the renewal of research culture and education within the humanities in general, adding value to traditional disciplinary curricula, as well as equipping students with skills relevant in the workplace. © 2020, University of Tartu Press.

New creative practices on internet. Some remarks on social media literature,2,10.7592/methis.v21i26.16917,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108233694&doi=10.7592%2fmethis.v21i26.16917&partnerID=40&md5=0829fd8e839760fe8b2c6318f52ca8af,"The concept of digital humanities has been intensively used only during the last fifteen years and, and according to the broadest definition, it refers to the study of social, cultural and creative activities of the era of digital technologies. One of the digital humanities’ research areas covers the relations between digital technologies and literature. This is a rapidly growing and changing field which, on the one hand, involves the application of the tools and methods of digital humanities in literary studies, (e.g., the quantitative analysis of literary works with the help of computer technology), on the other hand, it also includes digital cultural creativity practices – the description and analysis of digitally born works of literature (digital or electronic literature). Of the research objects of digital humanities, mentioned above, the present article focusses on digital literature, paying special attention to its newest and most widely-spread subcategory – the social media literature. The social media literature is connected with the development of the internet and the creation of the second-generation web design Web 2.0 in the late 20th and early 21st century. Web 2.0 forms the substratum for social media platforms, the largest and best-know of which are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat, etc. Social media platforms are usually simple, easy-to-use and do not require special technical skills, the content creation is made exceptionally convenient for the users. Among other types of content, social media includes literary works created by its users. While the essence of such literature is derived from the fact that the user of Web 2.0 can create or generate content, the architecture of each platform determines the type and form of literature which can be created on the platform. The examples of social media literature are Twitterature, Facebook poetry and serial stories, Instagram poetry, Tumblr poetry, stories written on Wattpad, literary blogs, etc. Social media literature has several characteristics of digital literature. Such literature is born-digital – born on social media platforms; these works are often multimodal, combining different media (adding images, sounds, videos to the texts), and often, these texts are also interactive (the readers can step in, comment on the works or even develop them further). Thus we can argue that social media literature really is a subcategory of digital literature. This article maps some theoretical concepts and approaches used earlier by different researchers, or which are relevant in the analysis of such type of literature. Social media literature has been examined in this article in the context of democratisation, amateurism and professionalism, participatory culture, interactivity of the author and the reader, multimodality, and ephemerality of literature. Attempts have been made to define the functions of social media literature, such as self-expression, self-branding and selfhelp. These concepts form the framework for the examples analysed in this article, ranging from Facebook literature to Instagram and Tumblr poetry and to Twitterature. Social media literature can be examined from the aspect of the democratisation of literature. On social media, each user can create literary content and take it to readers, the author does not depend on literary institutions (publishers, editors, etc.) in spreading their works. Unfortunately, the lack of institutional control on social media means that quality control is missing as well – everyone can become an author. Thus, the other aspect of the democratisation of literature is that in addition to high-quality works, social media is really flooded with amateurish literature. The concept of participatory culture can also be related with social media literature. One of the important manifestations characterising social media literature is interactivity, the dynamics of the authorreader relationship – the participation of readers in commenting on the literary work, in expressing their opinion, or even in the creation of the work. Compared to the traditional literature, the relationship between the author and the reader has changed, it is more immediate and it may have an effect on the process of creation. Multimodality is the term which characterises especially well the poetry written on Tumblr and Instagram. In the social media poetry, multimodality marks the joining together of different media, primarily the combining of texts with images, and sometimes adding sounds or a video. In addition to Tumblr and Instagram poetry, multimodality can be found in Facebook poetry or prose, in literary blogs, etc. Ephemerality denotes here the fleetingness, dispersal and temporality, characteristic to the digital world. Phenomena of digital culture have been seen as short-term, temporary and disappearing. Social media literature can also be characterised by ephemerality. The temporariness and disappearance of postings has intentionally been built into the social media platforms, e.g., into Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. The ephemerality of social media literature is, primarily, determined by technology and it is related to the structure and the principles of use of these platforms. Specifying the functions of social media literature, we can point out three different functions. First – creative self-expression, which is probably the decisive impulse for amateur authors, young authors, as well as for professional authors who use the social media platforms for spreading their literary works. Second – self-promotion and self-branding, as the greatest challenge facing the authors of social media literature is the finding of the readers. To be able to catch the readers’ attention, the authors who write on social media need to create a strong author image and relentlessly work on self-promotion. Third – selfhelp can also be classified as a function of social media literature. For example, the short and reassuring forms of Instagram poetry, on the beautifully designed and coloured background and accompanied by soft music, offer positive emotions and have a therapeutic effect. To sum it up, we should note that social media literature is located on the intersection of different fields of research, combining internet studies, literary studies, media studies and the studies of popular culture. Social media literature is a constantly developing field, responding to the development of technologies and the existing social media platforms, as well as to the appearance of new social media platforms. Therefore, it is important to follow the developments in social media literature to broaden our understanding of literature as a field of art, and to introduce to literary studies the new phenomena which can extend the boundaries of literature. © 2020, University of Tartu Press.

Creating dictionaries from large corpora of texts written in a natural language is a task that has not been a primary focus of research, as other tasks have dominated the field (such as chat-bots), but it can be a very useful tool in analysing texts. Even in the case of contemporary texts, categorizing the words according to their dictionary entry is a complex task, and for less conventional texts (in old or less researched languages) it is even harder to solve this problem automatically. Our task was to create a software that helps in expanding a dictionary containing word forms and tagging unprocessed text. We used a manually created corpus for training and testing the model.

In a number of non-English speaking countries it is common to use the original English term „digital humanities“ or its abbreviation DH. There is a discussion held in those countries as to how to translate this neologism (and whether to translate it at all), and it is considered necessary to open the discussion in the national academic environment, too. What is problematic in the discussion is the contradiction between the effort to systematically develop the particular national terminology and the difficulty to translate the expression exactly and accurately. This contradiction is shown in the national terminology environment by the intention to strictly translate „digital humanities“ into Slovak (most often as „digitálne humanitné vedy“) and by an opposite tendency to keep the term in the original English version. It is believed that mapping of the existing Slovak translations of the term and explanation of the arguments which can support the use of them may help open and productively steer the translatological discussion. © 2020, Institute of Slovak Literature SAS.

It demonstrates how historical perspectives can problematize and unsettle various automatisms that are widely present in journalistic, public, and policy discourses. Through examples from the Geo Archive, the article illustrates how unavoidable historical dimensions can enrich our understandings on the interaction between environmental issues and migration flows. This paper engages with an open access ""archive in-the-making"". This Geo Archive includes case studies of migration flows and puts those flows in conversation with environmental transformations and climatic changes. The analysed collection presents high-profile stories which are representative samples of different approaches, temporalities, geographies, sources of information, narratives, and scales. This endeavour encompasses different disciplines and fields of expertise: environmental humanities, IT and communication experts, and political ecology. The archive places itself within the realms of public history, environmental history, and history of the present and aims to reach out to wider audiences.

This is a creative expansion in critical GIS practices and a new alternative to traditionally science-rooted approaches to GIS and mapping. Reflecting the experience of teaching a “creative geovisualization” course in an interdisciplinary curriculum, I demonstrate how critical and creative scholarship with mapping and geovisualization is introduced in the classroom and is illuminated in the students' creative practices. The class encompasses key epistemological and methodological groundings of creative geovisualization—including non-representational theories; critical cartography and GIS; the convergence of geography, arts, and humanities; psychogeography; and qualitative and affective geovisualization. Empirical examples of students' works illustrate the blending of different modes of creative engagements with GIS and geovisualization and specific ways to work with various forms of embodied, relational, interpretive, and expressive geographies.

The designed prototype is motivated by a practical use case on a corpus of circa 15.000 digitized resources about European integration since 1945. The corpus allowed generating a dynamic multilayer network which represents different kinds of named entities appearing and co-appearing in the collections. To our knowledge, Intergraph is one of the first interactive tools to visualize dynamic multilayer graphs for collections of digitized historical sources. Graph visualization and interaction methods have been designed based on user requirements for content exploration by non-technical users without a strong background in network science, and to compensate for common flaws with the annotation of named entities. Users work with self-selected subsets of the overall data by interacting with a scene of small graphs which can be added, altered and compared. This allows an interest-driven navigation in the corpus and the discovery of the interconnections of its entities across time. © 2020, The Author(s).",Digital humanities,Dynamic multilayer networks,Network visualization,Visual analytics,,,,,Bornhofen S.,Düring M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order for humans to consciously participate in this expanded domain of sensibility, additional mediation is required to ‘presentify’ what is not accessible to human perception. This situation has motivated the creation of manifold ‘data objects’ in the form of visualizations, soundscapes and sonifications, 3D materializations, and data-driven interactives in the neighboring domains of art, design, science, and humanities scholarship. These new knowledge objects, as we propose to call them, both produce and mediate knowledge in the process of making data experienceable. They turn that what essentially does not correlate to human sensory capacities into something that the human sensorium is capable of engaging with. As such, they can play a crucial role in providing access, and thereby modalities of critical and creative relating, to what Hansen (2015) describes as the expanded domain of sensibility. Yet, the effects and implications of the sensory specificities of these knowledge objects remain underacknowledged, as are the potentials of these modes of presentifying data. Here, we explore and compare a diversity of such knowledge objects and look at their different media modalities and different experiential qualities, and how these afford ways of knowing. By approaching several knowledge objects as ‘theoretical objects’ (Bal (2013); Damisch in Bois et al. (1998), we investigate which and how experimental sensory techniques are used for data presentification. With this, we want to draw attention to the onto-epistemological implications of the design of these knowledge objects, the main implications being relationality and performativity. Understanding the potential and implications of this performativity would benefit from what we call a creative humanities approach that combines insights from the critical and digital humanities with those from the fields of creative arts and design. © The Author(s) 2020.",Creative humanities,critical interactives,curation,data materialization,data sonification,data visualization,dispositif,dramaturgy,Bleeker M.,Verhoeff N.,Werning S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disruption in medical education and training has adversely impacted traditional medical education and medical students and is likely to have long-term implications beyond COVID-19. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of the existing structural and systemic challenges applicable to medical students and teaching/training programs and the impact of COVID-19 on medical students and education. Use of technologies such as telemedicine or remote education platforms can minimize increased mental health risks to this population. An overview of challenges during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed, and targeted recommendations to address acute and systemic issues in medical education and training are presented. During the transition from conventional in-person or classroom teaching to tele-delivery of educational programs, medical students have to navigate various social, economic and cultural factors which interfere with their personal and academic lives. This is especially relevant for those from vulnerable, underprivileged or minority backgrounds. Students from vulnerable backgrounds are influenced by environmental factors such as unemployment of themselves and family members, lack of or inequity in provision and access to educational technologies and remote delivery-platforms, and increased levels of mental health stressors due to prolonged isolation and self-quarantine measures. Technologies for remote education and training delivery as well as sustenance and increased delivery of general well-being and mental health services to medical students, especially to those at high-risk, are pivotal to our response to COVID-19 and beyond. © Copyright © 2020 Sharma and Bhaskar.",Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),digital humanities,medical education,remote delivery,technologies,tele-education,telemedicine,training,Sharma D.,Bhaskar S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We introduce two approaches to data materialization currently used at the qCollaborative, an intersectional feminist design research lab with nodes at the University of Waterloo, Mount Royal University, and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The outcomes of these methods, which we call ""forcing connections between the digital and the material""and ""dwelling with embodied data in research scenes"", have included productive opportunities to: Relax behavioural expectations and inhibitions; leverage tacit as well as explicit knowledges; engage in processes of vulnerable co-creation; engage in equitable co-creation of knowledge across differences in lived experience; cycle through stages of public representation, gathering, and presentation; account for the complex events, actions, and contestations that influence our processes of data-production, analysis, and remediation; generate research products that can become future research scenes for equitable data-dwelling processes; and leverage old-media tactics to intervene into harmful, normative digital cultures; and generate new conceptual paradigms; and: Make explicit interventions into institutional cultures.

Ontologies provide a cushion for such practices in the semantic Web environment. This study aims to develop an ontology that can preserve the knowledge base of traditional dance practices. Design/methodology/approach: It is hypothesized that an ontology-based approach for the chosen domain might boost collaborative research prospects in the domain. A systematic methodology was developed for modeling the ontology based on the analytico-synthetic rule of library classification. Protégé 5.2 was used as an editor for the ontology using the Web ontology language combined with description logic axioms. Ontology was later implemented in a local GraphDB repository to run queries over it. Findings: The developed ontology on traditional dances (OTD) was tested using the dances of the Rabha tribes of North East India. Rabha tribes are from an indigenous mongoloid community and have a robust presence in Southeast Asian countries, such as Myanmar, Thailand, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. The result from HermiT reasoner found the presence of no logical inconsistency in the ontology, while the OOPS! pitfall checker tool reported no major internal inconsistency. The induced knowledge base of traditional dances of the Rabha’s in the developed OTD was further validated based on some competency questions. Research limitations/implications: In the growing trend of globalization, preservation of the cultural knowledge base of human societies is an important issue. Traditional dances reflect a strong base of the cultural heritage of human societies as they are closely related to the lifestyle, habitat, religious practices and festivals of a specific community. Originality/value: The current study is exclusively designed, keeping in mind the variables of traditional dance domain based on a survey of the user- and domain-specific needs.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes an ontology model for Chinese ancient architectures based on architectural narratives theory. To verify the availability of the ancient architecture ontology, we designed and implemented three experiments, including semantic retrieval based on SPARQL query, semantic reasoning with the use of Jena reasoner and visual analysis based on the Chinese Online Digital Humanities Resources Platform. Findings: The proposed ontology provided a solution for the semantic annotation of the unstructured information of Chinese ancient architectures. On this basis, deep knowledge services such as semantic retrieval, semantic reasoning and visual analysis can be provided. Practical implications: The proposed semantic model of ancient architectures can effectively improve the organization and access quality of the semantic content of Chinese ancient architectures.

Participatory design for ontologies: a case study of an open science ontology for qualitative coding schemas,5,10.1108/AJIM-11-2019-0320,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089457271&doi=10.1108%2fAJIM-11-2019-0320&partnerID=40&md5=28b46780d93dfe1755ce7f6cfd6bc358,"Purpose: The open science movement calls for transparent and retraceable research processes. While infrastructures to support these practices in qualitative research are lacking, the design needs to consider different approaches and workflows. The paper bases on the definition of ontologies as shared conceptualizations of knowledge (Borst, 1999). The authors argue that participatory design is a good way to create these shared conceptualizations by giving domain experts and future users a voice in the design process via interviews, workshops and observations. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a novel approach for creating ontologies in the field of open science using participatory design. As a case study the creation of an ontology for qualitative coding schemas is presented. Coding schemas are an important result of qualitative research, and reuse can yield great potential for open science making qualitative research more transparent, enhance sharing of coding schemas and teaching of qualitative methods. The participatory design process consisted of three parts: a requirement analysis using interviews and an observation, a design phase accompanied by interviews and an evaluation phase based on user tests as well as interviews. Findings: The research showed several positive outcomes due to participatory design: higher commitment of users, mutual learning, high quality feedback and better quality of the ontology. However, there are two obstacles in this approach: First, contradictive answers by the interviewees, which needs to be balanced; second, this approach takes more time due to interview planning and analysis. Practical implications: The implication of the paper is in the long run to decentralize the design of open science infrastructures and to involve parties affected on several levels. Originality/value: In ontology design, several methods exist by using user-centered design or participatory design doing workshops. In this paper, the authors outline the potentials for participatory design using mainly interviews in creating an ontology for open science. The authors focus on close contact to researchers in order to build the ontology upon the expert's knowledge. © 2020, Julian Hocker, Christoph Schindler and Marc Rittberger.",Coding schemas,Digital humanities,Ontology engineering,Open science,Participatory design,Qualitative research,Semantic web,,Hocker J.,Schindler C.,Rittberger M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ways in which DH is practiced will differ across national contexts, with each region having peculiarities representative of the culture-specific conditions which shaped the field as it first emerged and later developed. While scholars tend to belong and contribute to international communities of praxis, doing DH in one place might look very different to doing DH somewhere else. Disciplinary cultures are often transnational, but where scholars are trained and where they work will usually impact upon their own, individualised perspective of that discipline. This paper traces the history of the digital humanities in Ireland, providing on account of DH as it exists in a specifically Irish context. It mimics the Busa narrative, uncovering equivalent figures from Irish DH's origin story, while detailing some of the key initiatives and institutions to have contributed to the national development of the discipline. As a small island with a close-knit academic community, culturally torn between US, British and European influences, Ireland represents an opportunity to examine DH as a national project, and how such a project might be contrasted with international norms, what it achieved, and where it has failed. © 2020 The Author(s).",Digitial Humanities,Ireland,Irish DH,,,,,,O'Sullivan J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We discuss the multiple stages involved in integrating a physical exhibit of wearables within a database of born-digital artifacts. We argue that the inclusion of historic artifacts in Fabric effectively connects the past to the future, creating a dialogic relationship between digital artifacts rather than a hierarchical schema, facilitated by Fabric's metadata. Fabric provides a means to explore the cultural turn in wearable technology adoption, contextualized through a complex range of artifact representations. Following Bakhtin's notion of ""dialogic interaction,""we argue that the historic artifacts become dialogically entangled, and weave ""in and out of complex interrelationships""(Bakhtin 1981, 276-277). We use Carole L. Palmer's thematic research collections framework to explain the overarching structure and intent for Fabric's born-digital collections. We then proceed to explain how The Wearable Past weaves historical cultural narratives from material artifacts into Fabric. We argue that they persist amid technologies that are proposed for future bodies to wear, reframing the conceptualization of wearables as lived phenomena.

This gap is rapidly closing, and a variety of new resources, tools, and communities have developed in the last few years. At the same time, this progress has produced a remarkable flowering of research. This article provides a broad overview of some of the more recent and important trends in East Asian digital humanities. I discuss a variety of important datasets that include text corpora, geographic information, biographic data, images, and more. I also introduce a number of analytical tools, discuss community building efforts, and discuss some of the research that has emerged from this. Finally, I address efforts in digital humanities education, because although East Asian scholars are rapidly adopting digital tools, the field still faces a gap in knowledge driven by a lack of easily accessible training opportunities. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,,,Vierthaler P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Field work aims to study how creative computer agents and/or their products influence society, and how the dynamics that arise from the interaction between people and those inventive machines or their artifacts can inform the design of computational creativity methods, systems and artefacts. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences making our systems ALYSIA and MEXICA broadly available. In the case of ALYSIA, the system itself was made accessible, whereas MEXICA’s artifacts (stories) were shared through a traditionally published book for a broad readership. We then propose a five step methodology for effectively conducting field work in Computational Creativity.

Independent publishers and social networks in the 21st century: the balance of power in the transatlantic Spanish-language book market,1,10.1108/OIR-10-2019-0342,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092496635&doi=10.1108%2fOIR-10-2019-0342&partnerID=40&md5=e745bd6aeaedc5e7575f20777662d876,"Purpose: The present paper uses Twitter to analyze the current state of the worldwide, Spanish-language, independent publishing market. The main purposes are to determine whether certain Latin American Spanish-language independent publishers function as gatekeepers of world literature and to analyze the geopolitical structure of this global market, addressing both the Europe-America dialectic and neocolonial practices. Design/methodology/approach: After selecting the sample of publishers, the authors conducted a search for their Twitter profiles and located 131; they then downloaded data from the corresponding Twitter APIs. Finally, they applied social network analysis to study the presence of and interaction between the sample of independent publishers on this social media. Findings: The results provide data-based evidence supporting the hypothesis of some literary critics who suggest that in Latin America, certain publishers act as gatekeepers to the mainstream book market. Therefore, Twitter could be considered a valid source of information to address the independent book market in Spanish. By extension, this approach could be applied to other cultural industries in which small and medium-sized agents develop a digital presence in social media. Originality/value: This paper combines social network analysis and literary criticism to provide new evidence about the Spanish-language book market. It helps validate the aforementioned hypothesis proposed by literary critics and opens up new paths along which to pursue an interpretative, comparative analysis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Decolonial studies,Digital humanities,Independent publishers,Social network analysis,Transatlantic studies,Twitter,,,Gallego-Cuiñas A.,Romero-Frías E.,Arroyo-Machado W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has therefore become necessary to reflect on the following questions: what kind of new forms of organizations are needed to tackle real-world problems? How can we enhance the humanities as a responsive field with the ability to translate knowledge into actions? How can we design a better humanities laboratory that is more attuned to contemporary challenges? The social labs as innovative institutions have opened up new epistemological directions for understanding a lab as a platform for addressing complex issues. A laboratory can be understood as a way of thinking and acting that entails new social practices and new research modes. Drawing on social lab theories, critical infrastructure studies, and digital humanities infrastructure theories, this essay aims to present a new theoretical approach to conceptualizing a laboratory in the humanities. I discuss two epistemological perspectives represented by Bruno Latour and Graeme Gooday in order to disclose the power of the laboratory. Next, I present the principles and network structure of social labs. Then, I introduce the concept of the infrastructure of engagement as a new analytical framework for understanding a laboratory as a site of intervention for the humanities as they are involved in addressing pressing global problems. Based on the Humanities Action Lab, I seek to reimagine a laboratory guided by the principles of collaborative infrastructure, participatory approach, and public engagement. © 2020. The Author(s).

When combined with close reading, these patterns facilitate insight into how sound was interpreted and communicated in time periods for which no sound recording technology existed. This article centers on the literary works of gothic author Ann Radcliffe (1764-1823), whose texts have been recognized for their inclusion of rich descriptions of sound. I examine the results of text analysis and topic modeling performed on Radcliffe's corpus in the context of how contemporaneous aestheticians understood and wrote about sound. The results reveal that Radcliffe's sonic language encompasses a comprehensive and calculated narrative use of sound, which reflects an understanding of theories on obscurity, sublime terror, and associationism put forward by aestheticians during her time. On a larger level, this article illustrates the mutual value that stems from integrating digital humanities and sound studies research: analyzing sonic language expands the types of questions to which visually oriented digital humanities tools can be applied, and digital tools aid in excavating otherwise silent sound worlds of the past. © 2020 Proceedings of the International Geometry Center.

Preface: Natural hazard impacts on technological systems and infrastructures,0,10.5194/nhess-20-2627-2020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85092793525&doi=10.5194%2fnhess-20-2627-2020&partnerID=40&md5=c42aa0a6c281a14d6c706ad5d128c766,"Projected changes to design ice thickness as quantified in the study by Jeong et al. (2019) will be useful information for the development of climate-resilient design standards, codes, and guides for buildings and infrastructure. Caution in designing for ice loads at latitudes higher than 40 N is warranted due to projected increases in extreme ice thickness. As the results show, it is important to examine changes in the future probability of extreme ice loads occurring simultaneously with extreme wind load in northern NA because the compounding effect may lead to an increase in load larger than the increase in ice load or wind load alone. The methodology proposed by Fluixá-Sanmartín et al. (2019) allows a detailed quantification of the effect of climate change on dam safety, which is one of the main concerns of the managers and technicians of this critical infrastructure for water supply and energy production worldwide. It can serve as a useful guide for dam owners and dam safety practitioners in the analysis of other study cases by encompassing different models and data sources. This would eventually allow a more efficient planning of dam safety investments in the long term and even the adaptation of existing dam exploitation rules. Sayão et al. (2020) also deal with dam safety but from a seismic hazard point of view. They introduce the issue of the visualization of databases, while Petrova (2020) and Frolova et al. (2020) also deal with databases of natural hazard impacts on infrastructure, providing useful tools for further research. Williams et al. (2020) conclude that the fragility functions show a trend of lower tsunami vulnerability (through lower probabilities of reaching or exceeding a given damage level) for road-use categories of potentially higher construction standards; bridges are more vulnerable to the impacts of tsunamis than roads; however, bridges are better designed to withstand the forces of tsunami loading and have a lower level of vulnerability at all hazard intensities (inundation depth) compared to buildings; culverts represent particularly vulnerable sections of roads. The topographic setting is also shown to affect the vulnerability of transportation assets in a tsunami. Braud et al. (2020) proposed the methodology that is robust, relevant, and generic enough to evaluate a nonquantitative method of runoff hazard mapping using localized runoffrelated proxy data. The results from their case study confirm that the susceptibility maps produced by the IRIP model provide relevant information related to runoff and that they can be used to design risk management strategies, as illustrated in the railway context. Among all the identified types of natural hazards in the study by Petrova (2020), hydrometeorological hazards such as heavy snowfalls and rains, floods, and ice phenomena, as well as dangerous exogenous slope processes including snow avalanches, debris flows, landslides, and rock falls, were revealed as having the largest contributions to transport accidents and disruptions. The most dangerous is the combination of heavy precipitations and strong winds. Regional differences in the risk of transport accidents between Russian federal regions were found and analyzed. Toma-Danila et al. (2020) and Mossoux et al. (2019) deal with the vulnerability of the transport infrastructure and, more precisely, the road network. This is important in emergency management in the case of a natural disaster (earthquake and volcanic eruption) in order to access such infrastructure as hospitals. Chen et al. (2019) consider the effects of human engineering in increasing landslide susceptibility and effects on infrastructure, providing case studies of two landslides in the vicinity of bridges. If the analysis of transport infrastructure may lead to better planning by providing new road segments and new infrastructure, then in the case of human engineering, land use change, a nonstructural measure, can also be undertaken to provide better land use through regional plans. Looking at the lessons learned from the database and information visualization papers which promote the conversion of data to information – and thus the digital humanities – as well as at the urban, regional, and mobility plans which are necessary to better manage transportation networks and human engineering activities, how other disciplines can contribute to natural hazard research is also highlighted. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

In this paper, we employ the findings obtained during the development of a novel visual text analytics tool we built in previous studies, GlassViz, to automatically detect interesting knowledge associations and groups of common interests between these communities of practice. Our proposed method relies on the statistical modeling of author-assigned keywords to make its findings, which are demonstrated in two use cases.

Because of this, Western scholars generally assume that certain figures are canonical everywhere in the world, such as Shakespeare and Dante. This paper proposes a new and different approach to the study of literary canonicity, by drawing on an almost completely untapped dataset (the 310 global Wikipedias) and comparing Wikipedia popularity and newly collected data on book translations. By examining diverse measures of global popularity of a corpus of 101 modern Italian poets, I aim both to integrate a new resource (Wikipedia) into the study of world literature as well as to newly problematize the very concept of world literature. I will show how shifting one’s criterion of canonicity – whether the number of translations or the number of Wikipedia pageviews of an author – affects our understanding of what makes an author canonical or not. In the end, I argue, we have not yet developed a subtle enough way to determine the canonicity of authors. But this dual strategy of comparing translations and Wikipedia popularity does show us a potential way forward. © British Comparative Literature Association www.euppublishing.com/ccs.",Digital humanities,Italian literature,Poetry translation,Sociology of literature,Wikipedia,World literature,,,Blakesley J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many reasons have led to the increasing digitization of archival documents, library and museum material, and collections of old books and manuscripts stored in monasteries. one of the main reasons for the digitization of old texts is to protect the original document from possible damage resulting from inappropriate handling. the use of digital copies instead of original documents is necessary to protect and preserve old written texts, as they are the most reliable way to back up original documents. Another very important reason for digitizing old texts is to make them more accessible to scholars, experts, and the public. In this way, young people who prefer using digital media will become more easily acquainted with cultural heritage that would otherwise be inaccessible to them. the digitization model of old Croatian grammar books will be discussed, as the existing resources do not include grammar books from the pre-standard period of the Croatian language. © 2020 Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics.

However, it largely lacks interpretive concepts. What should be done with the results generated in this way? How can we draw scientific conclusions from them? This is all the more difficult to answer as it still remains unclear where to position deep-learning approaches in the canon of digital-humanities methods. But it is clear that humanities scholars must reckon with machines being responsible for, or at least involved in, the creation of their objects of study. After a historical introduction to automated poetry generation, we try to conceptualize neural-net poetry and argue that its interpretation, i.e. the close reading of texts generated that way, based on large source corpora, can be an insightful addition to the toolbox of computational literary studies, an approach in development that we suggest calling “neural reading.” Our main argument is that artificial neural networks are able to reproduce parts of the stylistic features of a training sample, in our case poetic corpora, acting as a kind of digital echo chamber of literary history. These features are mainly observed in smaller language units, at the level of morphology, vocabulary, syntax, and prosody. Our findings open new directions for the study of style in larger corpora. We will illustrate this with three Russian corpora (a selection of translated hexameters from the eighteenth to the twentieth century and the poetry of Natalia Azarova and Vladimir Vysotsky) and one German corpus (collected poems of Friedrich Hölderlin). © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Subject indexing in humanities: a comparison between a local university repository and an international bibliographic service,3,10.1108/JD-12-2019-0231,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085699359&doi=10.1108%2fJD-12-2019-0231&partnerID=40&md5=0cb68897e5e0e52b90ed1f5be81f728d,"Purpose: As the humanities develop in the realm of increasingly more pronounced digital scholarship, it is important to provide quality subject access to a vast range of heterogeneous information objects in digital services. The study aims to paint a representative picture of the current state of affairs of the use of subject index terms in humanities journal articles with particular reference to the well-established subject access needs of humanities researchers, with the purpose of identifying which improvements are needed in this context. Design/methodology/approach: The comparison of subject metadata on a sample of 649 peer-reviewed journal articles from across the humanities is conducted in a university repository, against Scopus, the former reflecting local and national policies and the latter being the most comprehensive international abstract and citation database of research output. Findings: The study shows that established bibliographic objectives to ensure subject access for humanities journal articles are not supported in either the world's largest commercial abstract and citation database Scopus or the local repository of a public university in Sweden. The indexing policies in the two services do not seem to address the needs of humanities scholars for highly granular subject index terms with appropriate facets; no controlled vocabularies for any humanities discipline are used whatsoever. Originality/value: In all, not much has changed since 1990s when indexing for the humanities was shown to lag behind the sciences. The community of researchers and information professionals, today working together on digital humanities projects, as well as interdisciplinary research teams, should demand that their subject access needs be fulfilled, especially in commercial services like Scopus and discovery services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bibliographic databases,Digital humanities,Digital libraries,Humanities,Institutional repositories,Knowledge organization,Subject indexing,,Golub K.,Tyrkkö J.,Hansson J.,Ahlström I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes articles containing Digital Humanities research in the Web of Science Core Collection as of December 2018. First, co-occurrence data representing collaborations among nations were extracted from author affiliations. Second, the descriptive statistics, network indicators and international communities were calculated. Third, the research topics of different cross-national collaboration communities based on ISI keywords, author keywords, title and abstracts were detected. Findings: The results show that the scope of international collaborations in Digital Humanities research is broad, but the distribution among nations is unbalanced. The USA, Germany and England were identified as the major contributors. Five research communities are identified, led by the USA, Germany, England, Belgium and France. The communities share common research topics such as history, GIS, text mining, visualization, while each has its own research emphasis.

It begins by addressing the challenges of contemporaneity and multidisciplinarity in researching the creation, circulation and use of books. We identify a rigidity that limits existing theoretical frameworks for the study of book cultures, and a paucity in existing research modes–including those from literary sociology, the digital humanities and cultural analytics–that collect, count and model book cultures. Our alternative epistemology, Ullapoolism, draws on two modes of action developed by the Situationist International–détournements, mischievous re-inscriptions of existing cultural artefacts; and dérives, active drifts through space attuned to emotion–and addresses potential predicaments including recuperation and entanglement. The situated knowledge produced through this epistemology has practical applications. Fields are not neutral, and as mischief-making activists, we use creative critique and playful experimentalism to oppose structural inequity. Ullapoolism therefore offers a future programme for both cultural analysis and scholarly activism. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",autoethnographic epistemology,book cultures,publishing studies,scholarly activism,Situationist International,Ullapoolism,,,Driscoll B.,Squires C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is mainly due to both the implementation of tools for the statistical treatment of textual data, as well as the rapid expansion of the Internet in terms of online availability of archives and collections. Notwithstanding a series of contributions highlighting the mutual benefits derived from the combination of computational methods and literary scholarship, traditional criticism seems to ignore the epistemological continuum between qualitative and quantitative approaches to literature, treating them as two separate impermeable realities. In this article I will attempt to reconcile these approaches by presenting an exercise in computational criticism about the linguistic and ideological constructions at the basis of the rising genre of Augustan England: the novel. The aim is to examine the keywords at the core of the extensively theorised modern paradigm of empirical narratives so as to disclose which lexical units may be seen as the distinctive trait of fictionality as well as those which constitute the figure of the novelistic canon. In this way, the article provides an example of how the application of quantitative methods in literary and cultural scholarship can enhance the quality of individual research in the pursuit of the validity of interpretation. © 2020 Goteborgs Universitet.

At stake in this contradiction isn't just the relationship between digital enthusiasm and spatial theory (or the wider spatial turn), but the theoretical status of the visual itself in spatial scholarship. It raises a crucial question: how does visual material—everything from today's statistical maps and cutting-edge data graphics to the broader use of primary-source photographs or drawings—in fact shape our understanding of space, and what theoretical work does it do? By extension, how can humanists make critical theoretical interventions through their own visual production? This article proposes an analytic vocabulary of “visual argument” grounded in an image-focused rereading of two canonical bodies of work: the neo-Marxist theory most cited by spatial history (Henri Lefebvre, David Harvey, Doreen Massey, and Edward Soja) and the conspicuously uncited work of Fernand Braudel. By focusing on how these authors’ illustrations make claims about spatial subjectivity and the historicity of space—especially through visual relationships of background and foreground—I argue for a new way of understanding and responding to this work and to the visual project of spatial history today. A visual analysis highlights not only the limitations of neo-Marxism but also the pervasiveness of certain assumptions—shared across the neo-Marxists, Braudel, and digital visualization—about temporality, the natural/human dichotomy, and the methodological tensions between argument and visualization. I present my own mapping of Phoenix as one possibility for an argument-driven rethinking of familiar visual commitments, which also suggests a broader meditation on the relationship between visual and textual scholarship. © 2020 Wesleyan University",digital humanities,Fernand Braudel,mapping,neo-Marxism,spatial history,visual argument,,,Rankin W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It focuses on Facebook's Flux architecture. Flux is a design pattern—a term borrowed from architecture to denote repeatable solutions to reoccurring problems—meant to facilitate feed-forward state management, a solution necessary in very-large-scale data-driven applications. The article considers Flux, which simplifies a programmer's expressive potential, an example of rhetorical detractio, the process of saying less in order to focus audience attention. By exploring Flux as detractio, it is possible to make specific arguments about Facebook's role in shaping public argumentation. Facebook is often accused of being a space in which it is difficult to argue because the software discourages reflection and encourages a series of escalating hot takes. Flux removes the process of feedback from platform algorithms and contributes to this lack of feedback at the user level. The article concludes that rhetorical code study is a crucial methodology for studying digital writing that accounts for discursive effects and the manufacture of rhetorical situations by platform algorithms at the level of the code itself. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",algorithm studies,critical code studies,digital humanities,digital rhetoric,facebook,infrastructure studies,rhetorical code studies,social media,Pilsch A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This line of inquiry has been pursued through an analysis of parliamentary speeches made in the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the period from 23 June 2015 (1 year before the EU Referendum) through October 2018, facilitated by the use of computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software. Although multiple ‘family of nations’ metaphors were identified, British parliamentarians made more references to the Commonwealth as a family unit than other multi-national groupings, and two prominent variants of this family metaphor have been defined. Speakers competed for control over the meaning of the base metaphor, with mainly English Conservative speakers communicating a positive aspirational variant (framing the Commonwealth as a historically rooted, harmonious and prosperous alternative to the EU), while speakers from the other main parties communicated a competing critical judgmental variant (framing the Commonwealth as discriminatory, unequal and failing to defend shared human rights principles). It is argued that this metaphor, and particularly its positive aspirational variant, contributes to a broader communicative effort to encourage the imagination of a transnational and global British orientation and identity outside Europe. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Brexit,Britain,Commonwealth family,Digital humanities,Metaphor,Politics,,,Eaton M.Ø.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The paper documents and analyses both the existing literature on promoting sustainability for the outputs of digital humanities projects and the innovative approach of a single large-scale project. Findings: The findings of the research presented show that sustainability planning for large-scale research projects needs to consider data and technology but also community, communications and process knowledge simultaneously. In addition, it should focus not only on a project as a collection of tangible and intangible assets, but also on the potential user base for these assets and what these users consider valuable about them. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions of the paper have been formulated in the context of one specific project. As such, it may amplify the specificities of this project in its results. Practical implications: An approach to project sustainability following the recommendations outlined in this paper would include a number of uncommon features, such as a longer development horizon, wider perspective on project results, and an audit of tacit and explicit knowledge. Social Implications: These results can ultimately preserve public investment in projects.

However, this can be achieved only if all specialists involved develop ways to deal with ambiguity in the sources: instead of disambiguation we need mixed approaches that allow for data to have multiple meanings and for interpretation of meaning to change over time.

Recent developments in the digital humanities field and the need for extracting information from the historical documents have fastened the digitization processes. Cutting edge machine learning methods are applied to extract meaning from these documents. Page segmentation (layout analysis), keyword, number and symbol spotting, handwritten text recognition algorithms are tested on historical documents. For most of the languages, these techniques are widely studied and high performance techniques are developed. However, the properties of Arabic scripts (i.e., diacritics, varying script styles, diacritics, and ligatures) create additional problems for these algorithms and, therefore, the number of research is limited. In this research, we first automatically spotted the Arabic numerals from the very first series of population registers of the Ottoman Empire conducted in the mid-nineteenth century and recognized these numbers. They are important because they held information about the number of households, registered individuals and ages of individuals. We applied a red color filter to separate numerals from the document by taking advantage of the structure of the studied registers (numerals are written in red). We first used a CNN-based segmentation method for spotting these numerals. In the second part, we annotated a local Arabic handwritten digit dataset from the spotted numerals by selecting uni-digit ones and tested the Deep Transfer Learning method from large open Arabic handwritten digit datasets for digit recognition. We achieved promising results for recognizing digits in these historical documents. © 2020 by the authors.",Convolutional neural networks,Deep transfer learning,Handwritten digit recognition,Historical document analysis,Numeral spotting,,,,Can Y.S.,Kabadayi M.E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To create a dataset of Roman law publications, we retrieved a total of 21,300 records of publications, published between years 1500 and 2016, with title including words denoting ""Roman law""in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. We were able to find publications dating back to 1727. The largest number of publications and authors date to the late 19th century, and this peak might be explained by the role of Roman law in French legal education at the time. Furthermore, we found exceptionally skewed concentration of publications to authors, as well as of citations to publications. We speculate that this could be explained by the long time-frame of the study, and the importance of classic works. Major limitations, and potential future work, relate to data quality, and cleaning, disambiguation of publications and authors, as well as comparing coverage with other data sources. We find Google Scholar to be a promising data source for historical bibliometrics. This approach may help bridge the gap between bibliometrics and the ""digital humanities"".

Then the presentation of material in the printed Editio Critica Maior is introduced and it is shown how to use it. Since the New Testament tradition is characterized by contamination, which makes the application of the classical ""Lachmannian""stemmatology impossible, a new method had to be developed for the penetration of the New Testament manuscript tradition, the so-called Coherence-Based Genealogical Method (CBGM), which is explained as short and simple as possible.

Using records of mulberry crop failures as examples, the authors ask how gazetteer editors collated Yuan disaster records-initially collected to help prevent disasters and authorize the legitimacy of dynastic rule-in gazetteers and, in so doing, made them into 'local' knowledge. Digital humanities methods allow for both qualitative and quantitative analyses, and the authors deploy them to demonstrate how, in structured texts like the Chinese local gazetteers, they could help combine close reading of specific sections and larger-scale analysis of regional patterns. In the first part, the authors show how disasters were recorded in a Yuan Zhenjiang gazetteer to facilitate taxation and disaster prevention locally- A strategy rarely traceable in subsequent gazetteers until the Qing. In the second part, the authors shifted their perspective to the historical accumulation of data and what that reveals about the reception of Yuan disasters: Whereas local gazetteers from the north generate long chronologies of mulberry disasters from the Ming to the Qing, others depict the south as disaster-free. © 2020 The Author(s).

Historical poetics and the definition of epic in the eighteenth century,2,10.1111/lic3.12576,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088241724&doi=10.1111%2flic3.12576&partnerID=40&md5=2287e17e01f44481e60aa35c5ede1edc,"What was the epic for eighteenth-century Anglophone readers and writers? And how did those expectations differ from later definitions of the genre? This paper advocates an approach to historical poetics centered on these questions. Older approaches to historical poetics, including Mikhail Bakhtin's influential theory of the novel, impose modern ideas of post-Miltonic decline and modern expectations of epic as a rigid, “half-moribund,” “classic” genre, representative of an inaccessible, “absolute past.” Yet eighteenth-century writers approached the epic as a living genre defined by its capacity to “form the manners,” even in the present moment. Resurrecting this lost understanding could provide a large-scale analytical framework supportive of various kinds of historicist research now prevalent in eighteenth-century studies—book history, intellectual history, theory, criticism, and the digital humanities—to accommodate new models for thinking about the rise and fall of genres. The most obvious payoffs are local. Reviving old definitions of epic accommodates an earlier hierarchy of poetic making in which translation was not deemed inferior to original composition, and in which epic canons were not yet dominated by Homer and Dante. Alternative contemporary approaches to historical poetics and genre assert the primacy of philosophically-logical definitions of genre, or of generic rules derived from hyper-canonical examples; the present approach seeks newfound coherence in the previously marginalized or misunderstood. Historical poetics can unearth forgotten connections, reveal the eighteenth century as something other than an epic wasteland, and—by recovering lost abstractions—facilitate more global, cross-linguistic comparisons than familiar, racialized, Western-centered ideas of epic encourage. Recovering lost generic definitions also demands meta-critical reflection on the descriptive limitations of modern(ist) conceptions, including confidence in “genre memory.” The case of the epic demonstrates that genres do not always remember their pasts. Even classic genres suffer desuetude and deprecation that modern interpreters must work imaginatively to overcome. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,,,Foy A.M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Singapore Historical Geographic Information System (SHGIS) and the Singapore Biographical Database (SBDB) are expandable WebGIS platforms gathering and linking data on cultural and religious networks across Southeast Asia. This inter-connected platform can be expanded to cover not only Singapore but all of Southeast Asia. We have added layers of data that go beyond Chinese Taoist, Buddhist, and popular god temples to also display the distributions of a wide range of other religious networks, including Christian churches, Islamic mosques, Hindu temples, and Theravadin, which are the Taiwanese, Japanese and Tibetan Buddhist monasteries found across the region. This digital platform covers a larger area than the Taiwan History and Culture in Time and Space (THCTS) historical GIS platform but is more regionally focused than the ECAI (Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative) By incorporating Chinese inscriptions, extensive surveys of Chinese temples and associations, as well as archival and historical sources, this platform provides new materials and new perspectives on the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia. This paper: (1) outlines key research questions underlying these digital humanities platforms; (2) describes the overall architecture and the kinds of data included in the SHGIS and the SBDB; (3) reviews past research on historical GIS; and provides (4) a discussion of how incorporating Chinese epigraphy of Southeast Asia into these websites can help scholars trace networks across the entire region, potentially enabling comparative work on a wide range of religious networks in the region.

On the 10-year anniversary of minecraft: two interventions in extractive colonialism,1,10.1177/1474474019890319,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076846098&doi=10.1177%2f1474474019890319&partnerID=40&md5=911b08904c86e2806724fcabbf63fe58,"In light of the 10-year anniversary of the release of Minecraft, the wildly popular survival/building game, this retrospective considers the game as a vastly impactful digital text of settler colonialism. The ways in which the game’s ‘survival mode’ approaches the extraction of resources from land is fundamentally entangled in colonial fictions of indigeneity, gendered systems of property, and a Euro-humanist sense of entitlement and ownership. Considering Minecraft as a colonial text allows for two theoretical and aesthetic interventions: first, the visual art of Peruvian-American Eamon Ore-Giron, who challenges colonial extractivism in the two-channel piece, Morococha, and second, the 2006 flash game released by XGen Studies, Motherload, which approaches mining-based gameplay with key differences. These two interventions highlight the importance of digital realms as a terrain of colonial space-making and thus a site of analysis for cultural geographers. Moreover, they may help to chart useful paths to the production and realization of anti-colonial digital textuality. © The Author(s) 2019.",colonial geographies,colonialism,digital humanities,extractivism,minecraft,space-making,video games,,Brazelton B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since this interrelation between the real and fictional has become a blurred one, new layers of meaning have been attributed to the geographical places and their potential economic benefit when used in relation to tourist attractions. The process of this hyper-realization, a technologically and culturally mediated experience that takes reality to its limits, is nowadays impacting the most actual practices of cultural tourism in Italy and beyond. Introduced by the intersection between fiction and reality and put into practice by means of geospatial technologies, the use of advanced ""interactive maps"" and GPS-based applications as means of orientation is constantly changing the concept of literary pilgrimages and ""jet-setting"" tourism. The aim of this presentation is to reflect on the intersection between actual concepts such as ""reading spaces"" as defined by Westphal and Baudillard's ""hyper-reality"" that do not only endow the idea of traveling with a different, modified character, but also tend to merge real spaces, fictional places and virtual maps, and, thus, modify the concept of ""reality"" itself. © 2020 Palimpsest.

We analyze, on the one hand, the linkage between humanities and computers, understanding it as an exercise of enthusiasm and conservation, as far as technologies are either approached as future possibilities or held responsible for the dissolution of our professional field. We also address, on the other hand, certain pressures suffered by history as a discipline and the consequent desire for being updated, in view of a recent study by Valdei Araujo and Mateus Pereira regarding “updatism”. Technological disruption seems to be shaping new identities for history and historians, while enlarging the frontiers of the history and reinventing its traditions. Internet projects, for example, from YouTube channels to podcasts, are emerging as new outlets for professional action and represent the (con)figurations of historians in times marked by innovation. Lastly, we briefly discuss the discipline of emerging theoretical fields or movements such as digital humanities and digital history. Is there any reason to restrict the digital sphere to disciplinary boundaries? We argue that digital re-creations of the past, stimulated by highly sophisticated technologies, must inspire historical imagination, while remaining always untied to disciplinary imperatives. © 2020, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

Building virtual collection and Spanish colonial imprints of the Philippines,0,10.1108/CC-07-2019-0020,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078988625&doi=10.1108%2fCC-07-2019-0020&partnerID=40&md5=9e740b94db6d318ac9cc32d61ed53541,"Purpose: The access to the rare originals of the early Spanish colonial imprints of the Philippines remains problematic. The reference librarians often are restricted to directing the students and scholars to the secondary resources that are available both in print and as a part of the digital assets within the North American academic libraries. This paper aims to focus on the select primary source editions including select Spanish language colonial imprints that are available electronically on the Web along the Open Access. These Web-based resources serve as the reference tools for the early history of the Philippines and Southeast Asia. As many of these publications are rare and extremely expensive for most libraries, the Open Access resources serve as an aid to building a virtual collection of these items. Design/methodology/approach: The author had to create a data set of the early imprints of the Spanish Philippines using several bibliographic resources. The data set will be submitted as an Appendix for this research paper. The author did both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data set along with the voyant-based digital humanities approach for topic modeling. Findings: The goals of this paper were to not only survey the early Spanish printing of the Philippines but also provide the reader with a somewhat complete picture of how the printing began in the Spanish Philippines, what kind of the first books were printed and how one can access them given their rarity and fragility. The collection building paradigms are undergoing significant shifts, and the focus of many academic libraries is shifting toward providing access to these items. As these items high-value low-use items continue to be part of the Special Collections, the access to these is problematic. The virtual collections thus serve as a viable alternative that enables further research and access. While the creators of these works are long gone, the legacy of the Spanish colonial domination, printing and the religious orders in the Philippines remain alive through these works. Research limitations/implications: As this is an introductory paper, the author focused on the critical editions rather than providing a comprehensive bibliographic landscape of the presses that produced these editions. He also did not take into consideration many pamphlets that were published in the same period. He also did not consider the Chinese language publications of the Islands. The Chinese had been block printing since medieval times (Little, 1996). In the context of the Spanish Philippines, the Chinese migration and trade have been studied in detail by Chia (2006), Bjork (1998) and Gebhardt (2017). The scope of this paper also was centered toward building a virtual collection of these rare books. Practical implications: Rare books are often expensive and out-of-reach for many libraries; the virtual collection of the same along the Open Access model represents an alternative to collect and curate these collections. The stewardship of these collections also acquires a new meaning in the digital milieu. Social implications: This research paper will allow scholars to see past the analog editions and help them focus on curating a virtual collection. The questions of electronic access are often ignored when it comes to visiting and using them in a controlled environment of the reading room in the Special Collections. The author argues that one way to enable access to these rare and expensive books is to provide access to their digital counterparts. These digital/virtual surrogates of the originals will facilitate further research. Originality/value: The author could not find similar research on the publications of the early Spanish colony of the Philippines. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital collection,Digital curation,Open Access,Spanish printing in the Philippines,Virtual collections,Web librarianship,,,Pendse L.R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The second part of the article therefore reflects on how the concept of the “imperial biography” might be relevant for future biographical research. The authors propose a number of modifications to the core ideas of the imperial biography, including a broadening of the target group being studied, a focus on trans-local personal networks and increased use of digital methods. © 2020 Franz Steiner Verlag Wiesbaden GmbH.

If digitized, connected, and analysed within the scope of digital humanities, these historical events will provide a new perspective for the study of humanities. However, it is hard to construct a universal rule for description. This study aims to design an event-based ontology that models, organizes, and represents historical events in an explicit way. Procedures for the construction of the historical event-based ontology are as follows: Identifying and selecting typical events based on trigger words, analyzing the constituent elements of historical events, reusing concepts and properties by referencing existing ontology vocabularies, establishing the historical event-based ontology model, and validating the model with actual historical data. The verification results of each type of event and each instance are displayed in visual forms. A representative historical figure associated with several types of events is selected, and the event relationship network is established. With great potential to be further developed, the model will help historical scholars deal with areas such as economic and micro-social history. Future research will input more complete data to enlarge the scale of the model. © 2020 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.",,,,,,,,,He L.,Linlin Z.,Wang S.,Xingye D.,Shuhe G.,Jun D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed model, which resembles a knowledge-related network, is useful for the multidimensional display of resources and is facilitative to in-depth explorations in COM research. Supplemented by visual examples, this model can demonstrate the aggregative and escalating processes (from data to information and then to knowledge linkage) of COM.

A Data-driven Approach for Architectural History Knowledge.

These solutions seek to support diverse users of the research community with the aim of solving challenges directly related with the digitalisation, structuring, standardisation, and management of historical information. These challenges include, for example, the creation of a digital support that enables a collaborative growth and management of information, the normalisation of terms and vocabularies to make its analysis efficient, the elaborating of a conceptual model, and the development of a metadata support that allows its more expanded dissemination and reuse. This article describes a case study project in which the documents of archives, of research, and of projects previously carried out by the Late Gothic Network (Red Tardogótica) are the raw material for the proposal of an event-oriented historical database (e-database). This e-database means to record and systematise the information about the artistic transfers related with the architectural production in the transition of the Modern Age, a period also known as the Late Gothic. The e-database's design has considered the possibility of its use for the analysis of social networks (abstract-relational model, a Graph model) and the spatiotemporal analysis of the events (geo-temporal model, GIS). The main section of this article describes the architecture of the database, with a view to addressing the questions of the relations between the datasets and the matter of implementing the thesauri and controlled vocabularies that must be respected for the standardisation, recording, and later analysis of the data. Next, we contribute quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the database's important gaps of information. This proposal initially covers the geographical framework of the western Andalusian territory, but it can be expanded to other areas and adapted to other case studies. Finally, the article summarises the learning achieved in this first phase of the case study project and describes the perspectives to broaden its use in the community of architectural history researchers. © 2020 ACM.",artistic transfer,cultural heritage,digital humanities,event database,History of architecture,Modern Age,,,Ferreira-Lopes P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Romantic disciplinarity and the rise of the algorithm,2,10.1086/709225,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087362571&doi=10.1086%2f709225&partnerID=40&md5=d434c344ba84aca0ec970bcade12c49f,"Scholars in both digital humanities and media studies have noted an apparent disconnect between computation and the interpretive methods of the humanities. Alan Liu has argued that literary scholars employing digital methods encounter a ""meaning problem"" due to the difficulty of reconciling algorithmic methods with interpretive ones. Conversely, the media scholar Friedrich Kittler has questioned the adequacy of hermeneutics as a means of studying computers. This paper argues that that this disconnect results from a set of contingent decisions made in both humanistic and mathematical disciplines in the first half of the nineteenth century that delineated, with implications that continue to resonate in the present day, which aspects of human activity would come to be formalized in algorithms and which would not. I begin with a discussion of Nicolas de Condorcet, who attempted, at the height of the 1789 revolution, to turn algebra into a universal language; his work, I argue, exemplifies the form of algorithmic thinking that existed before the Romantic turn. Next, I discuss William Wordsworth's arguments about the relationship of poetry and science. While Wordsworth is sometimes viewed as a critic of science, I argue that his polemic is specifically targeted at highly politicized projects like Condorcet's that sought to supplant existing modes of thought with scientific rationality. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of Romantic thought for George Boole, creator of the logic system that would eventually form the basis of digital electronics. The reason Boole was able to succeed where Condorcet had failed, I argue, was that Romantic notions of culture enabled him to reconcile a mechanical view of mathematical reasoning with an organic view of the development of meaning-a dichotomy that remains a key assumption of computer interfaces in the twenty-first century. © 2020 by The University of Chicago.",,,,,,,,,Binder J.M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Construction and Analysis of Classical Chinese Poetry Knowledge Graph,1,10.7544/issn1000-1239.2020.20190641,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086139386&doi=10.7544%2fissn1000-1239.2020.20190641&partnerID=40&md5=cf48e551dd19926ad7811dd813021dba,"Classical Chinese poetry is a precious cultural heritage. It is significant to use the rich information in classical Chinese poetry to further investigate the language, literature and historical development of Chinese culture. However, the knowledge of classical Chinese poetry is highly fragmented. It not only exists in poetry itself, but also is widely distributed in the materials which are used to explain poetry, such as annotations, translations, appreciations, etc. Our aim is to obtain the potential semantic relationship between words and expressions, and use knowledge graph to link them. By doing this, we could integrate fragmented knowledge in a systematic way, which enables us to achieve better reasoning and analysis of classical Chinese poetry knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to construct classical Chinese poetry knowledge graph (CCP-KG). About building nodes of CCP-KG, we use the improved Apriori algorithm to generate candidate words, then check if the candidate word appears in the annotations to determine when it can be a node of CCP-KG. About building edges of CCP-KG, the semantic relationship between words is established through the annotations, then we use the artificially constructed classical Chinese poetry hierarchical structure to establish the relationship between abstract semantics. Finally, we obtain CCP-KG, which covers every aspect of classical Chinese poetry and contains multi-layer semantic links between words. Taking Tang poetry as an example, CCP-KG can be used to analysis classical Chinese poems in different dimensions. Compared with character-based data analysis, the use of CCP-KG assists literary research more in-depth from the perspective of semantics. Therefore, CCP-KG is necessary in analyzing classical Chinese poems. In addition, CCP-KG can also be applied to various tasks like reasoning and analysis in classical Chinese poetry. We conduct experiments on the tasks of determining the theme of poetry and analyzing the emotion of poetry respectively, showing the effectiveness and application value of our constructed CCP-KG. © 2020, Science Press.

This place, where researchers conceptualize the multiple dimensions of their research subject, will then be defined as the foundation for a strong relationship between semiotics and computer science. We will see that the different definitions of the conceptual model converge on the thesis that scientific knowledge implements a conceptualization process that must identify the various dimensions of the problem in addition to having to express itself in such a way that it can be communicated between members of epistemic communities.

When these narratives become increasingly complex, pragmatics analysis (i.e., at discourse or argumentation levels) assisted by software is a great ally in the digital humanities.

This paper presents a wide and interdisciplinary systematic literature review (SLR), both in software-related areas and humanities areas, on the information visualization and the software solutions adopted to support pragmatics textual analysis. As a result of this review, this paper detects weaknesses in existing works on the field, especially related to solutions' availability, pragmatic framework dependence and lack of information sharing and reuse software mechanisms. The paper also provides some software guidelines for improving the detected weaknesses, exemplifying some guidelines in practice through their implementation in a new web tool, Viscourse.

A cooperative crowdsourcing framework for knowledge extraction in digital humanities – cases on Tang poetry,6,10.1108/AJIM-07-2019-0192,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083688822&doi=10.1108%2fAJIM-07-2019-0192&partnerID=40&md5=f465c0f16436e5d5ca5451b2035beb07,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a knowledge extraction framework to extract knowledge, including entities and relationships between them, from unstructured texts in digital humanities (DH). Design/methodology/approach: The proposed cooperative crowdsourcing framework (CCF) uses both human–computer cooperation and crowdsourcing to achieve high-quality and scalable knowledge extraction. CCF integrates active learning with a novel category-based crowdsourcing mechanism to facilitate domain experts labeling and verifying extracted knowledge. Findings: The case study shows that CCF can effectively and efficiently extract knowledge from multi-sourced heterogeneous data in the field of Tang poetry. Specifically, CCF achieves higher accuracy of knowledge extraction than the state-of-the-art methods, the contribution of feedbacks to the training model can be maximized by the active learning mechanism and the proposed category-based crowdsourcing mechanism can scale up the effective human–computer collaboration by considering the specialization of workers in different categories of tasks. Research limitations/implications: This research proposes CCF to enable high-quality and scalable knowledge extraction in the field of Tang poetry. CCF can be generalized to other fields of DH by introducing domain knowledge and experts. Practical implications: The extracted knowledge is machine-understandable and can support the research of Tang poetry and knowledge-driven intelligent applications in DH. Originality/value: CCF is the first human-in-the-loop knowledge extraction framework that integrates active learning and crowdsourcing mechanisms; he human–computer cooperation method uses the feedback of domain experts through the active learning mechanism; the category-based crowdsourcing mechanism considers the matching of categories of DH data and especially of domain experts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Crowdsourcing,Digital humanities,Human–computer cooperation,Knowledge extraction,Tang poetry,,,,Hong L.,Hou W.,Wu Z.,Han H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: This paper starts from the complexities of character recognition of mass CHAs, takes Sheng Xuanhuai archives crowdsourcing project of Shanghai Library as a case study, and makes use of the theories of archival science, including diplomatics of Chinese archival documents, and the historical approach of Chinese archival traditions as the theoretical basis and analysis methods. The results are generated through the comprehensive research. Findings: This paper points out that volunteer tasks of full-text generation include transcription, punctuation, proofreading, metadata description, segmentation, and attribute annotation in digital humanities and provides a metadata element set for volunteers to use in creating or revising metadata descriptions and also provides an attribute tag set. The two sets can be used across the humanities to construct overall observations about texts and the archives of which they are a part. Along these lines, this paper presents significant insights for application in outlining the principles, methods, activities, and procedures of crowdsourced full-text generation for mass CHAs.

Toward the optimized crowdsourcing strategy for OCR post-correction,3,10.1108/AJIM-07-2019-0189,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077616260&doi=10.1108%2fAJIM-07-2019-0189&partnerID=40&md5=b0767f70cb89c9c2f5eb83ae1248f640,"Purpose: Digitization of historical documents is a challenging task in many digital humanities projects. A popular approach for digitization is to scan the documents into images, and then convert images into text using optical character recognition (OCR) algorithms. However, the outcome of OCR processing of historical documents is usually inaccurate and requires post-processing error correction. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how crowdsourcing can be utilized to correct OCR errors in historical text collections, and which crowdsourcing methodology is the most effective in different scenarios and for various research objectives. Design/methodology/approach: A series of experiments with different micro-task’s structures and text lengths were conducted with 753 workers on the Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. The workers had to fix OCR errors in a selected historical text. To analyze the results, new accuracy and efficiency measures were devised. Findings: The analysis suggests that in terms of accuracy, the optimal text length is medium (paragraph-size) and the optimal structure of the experiment is two phase with a scanned image. In terms of efficiency, the best results were obtained when using longer text in the single-stage structure with no image. Practical implications: The study provides practical recommendations to researchers on how to build the optimal crowdsourcing task for OCR post-correction. The developed methodology can also be utilized to create golden standard historical texts for automatic OCR post-correction. Originality/value: This is the first attempt to systematically investigate the influence of various factors on crowdsourcing-based OCR post-correction and propose an optimal strategy for this process. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Crowdsourcing,Digital humanities,Historical texts,OCR post-correction,Task decomposition,Task optimization,,,Suissa O.,Elmalech A.,Zhitomirsky-Geffet M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a quasi-experiment using Transcribe-Sheng, which is a well-known crowdsourced manuscript transcription project in China, to investigate the influences of social value orientation and domain knowledge. The experiment lasted one month and involved 60 participants. ANOVA was used to test the research hypotheses. Moreover, inverviews and thematic analyses were conducted to analyze the qualitative data in order to provide additional insights. Findings: The analysis confirmed that in crowdsourced manuscript transcription, social value orientation has a significant effect on participants’ cooperation level and transcription quality; domain knowledge has a significant effect on participants’ transcription quality, but not on their cooperation level. The results also reveal the interactive effect of social value orientation and domain knowledge on cooperation levels and quality of transcription. The analysis of the qualitative data illustrated the influences of social value orientation and domain knowledge on crowdsourced manuscript transcription in detail. Originality/value: Researchers have paid little attention to the impacts of the psychological and cognitive factors on crowdsourced manuscript transcription. This study investigated the effect of social value orientation and the combined effect of social value orientation and domain knowledge in this context. The findings shed light on crowdsourcing transcription initiatives in the cultural heritage domain and can be used to facilitate participant selection in such projects. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Crowdsourced manuscript transcription,Cultural heritage domain,Digital humanities,Domain knowledge,Social value orientation,Volunteer selection,,,Zhang X.,Chen S.,Zhao Y.C.,Song S.,Zhu Q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Understanding co-editing mechanism of wiki-based digital humanities projects,0,10.1108/AJIM-08-2019-0214,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077519166&doi=10.1108%2fAJIM-08-2019-0214&partnerID=40&md5=2ae9283d37308e93c9fc65f50a29cfa7,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to reveal the co-editing mechanism aiming at content creation, and an entry of online encyclopedia is taken as a case, for the purpose of promoting and enhancing the development of wiki-based digital humanities projects (WDHPs), specifically, the projects that focus on gathering contextual information in the culture heritage domain. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory study was conducted by three steps. A representative entry’s editorial records were reorganized to obtain a data set of discussion statements (n=608), based on which linked-structures were built, and PageRank algorithm was used to analyze the co-editing process. Skewness statistic was applied to measure the consensus of co-editing, and consensus evolution over time was explored. Linear or curve fitting was performed to analyze the correlation between consensus evolution and its influential factors. Findings: In WDHPs, co-editing activity of content creation can be considered as a large-scale group discussion, consensus can evaluate the efficiency of co-editing, which evolves with time and is influenced by the number of statements, breadth and depth of argumentation structure. Taking “Mogao Grottoes” as an example, group discussions around 15 key issues dominate the content creating process, consensus is on a rise with time, finally reaches a relatively high level, and consensus evolution is more influenced by breadth than by depth of argumentation structure, which indicates that co-editing efficiency of “Mogao Grottoes” is fine and more argumentation in a depth manner should be guided. Practical implications: For researchers of WDHPs, it is beneficial to apply online encyclopedia platform combining with consensus analysis to develop WDHPs. For designers of WDHPs, the elements related to argumentation structure can be absorbed into the design to promote co-editing in an effective manner. For DH researchers, the analytic procedure can be beneficial of revealing the interest of contributors in a specific DH field. Originality/value: This research is novel in comprehensively understanding co-editing mechanism of content creation in WDHPs, resulting in a three-step analytic procedure of presenting co-editing process, evaluating and improving co-editing efficiency. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Co-editing,Consensus,Crowdsourcing,Culture heritage,Digital humanities,IBIS,,,Deng W.,Lv P.,Yi M.,Liu M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of such digital data is indispensable, not least for the discipline of Digital Humanities. It provides the foundation for computer-based analytical approaches in the humanities and cultural sciences. The cataloguing of printed sources is fully automated and virtually error-free, whereas handwritten records still need to be processed manually. Nevertheless, advances in optical character recognition (OCR), such as the use of neural networks that learn to decipher characters based on training data, are leading to ever lower error rates. However, digital transcription tools still have considerable difficulty in creating training data and correcting automatically recognised data. The paper describes the user-centred development of a transcription tool for the cataloguing of handwritten weather records from the 18th and 19th centuries.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are powerful techniques that can be used for extracting locations of geographic features from scanned maps if sufficient representative training data are available. Existing spatial data can provide the approximate locations of corresponding geographic features in historical maps and thus be useful to annotate training data automatically. However, the feature representations, publication date, production scales, and spatial reference systems of contemporary vector data are typically very different from those of historical maps. Hence, such auxiliary data cannot be directly used for annotation of the precise locations of the features of interest in the scanned historical maps. This research introduces an automatic vector-to-raster alignment algorithm based on reinforcement learning to annotate precise locations of geographic features on scanned maps. This paper models the alignment problem using the reinforcement learning framework, which enables informed, efficient searches for matching features without pre-processing steps, such as extracting specific feature signatures (e.g. road intersections). The experimental results show that our algorithm can be applied to various features (roads, water lines, and railroads) and achieve high accuracy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital humanities,digital map processing,reinforcement learning,USGS historical topographic maps,Vector-to-raster alignment,,,,Duan W.,Chiang Y.-Y.,Leyk S.,Uhl J.H.,Knoblock C.A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: Using computerized language analysis, we analyzed works from Poe's corpora of personal letters (N = 309), poems (N = 49), and short stories (N = 63), and investigated whether a pattern of linguistic cues consistent with depression and suicidal cognition were discernible throughout the writer's life, particularly in his final years. Building on past work, language scores were collapsed into a composite depression metric for each text. Data from each work type was subsequently compiled and graphed into a single plot by year, with scores exceeding the 95th percentile (p < 0.05) considered statistically significant and treated as potential depressive episodes. Results: Significant, consistent patterns of depression were not found and do not support suicide as a cause of death. However, linguistic evidence was found suggesting the presence of several potential depressive episodes over the course of Poe's life – these episodes were the most pronounced during years of Poe's greatest success, as well as those following the death of his late wife. Limitations: Given the sampling method, it is not possible to establish direct causality; results should be considered informed but tentative. Conclusion: This investigation demonstrates the utility of language analysis for capturing disruptive/maladaptive emotional responses to life events. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Depression,Digital humanities,Edgar Allan Poe,LIWC,Suicide,,,,Dean H.J.,Boyd R.L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper argues that the traditional view that information/knowledge is transferred from an information specialist donor to a domain specialist receiver is no longer appropriate in the digital humanities context, where the gap-and-search (or gap-and-filler) approach to information has given way to more direct, explorative engagement with information. The paper asks whether information science and the practising profession are ready for this paradigm shift and examines information science conservatism in two common collaboration scenarios, library support and digital development. It is shown that information science theory still assumes a traditional donor role in both scenarios. How information scientists deal with conservatism in practice is discussed in the example of the Prior project, in which the information science team exerted an ambiguous, hybrid approach with both conservative and non-conservative elements. Finally, two rather hypothetical answers are offered to the question of how information professionals should approach scholarly collaboration in the digital humanities context, where users have ceased to be supplicants. From a purely pragmatic perspective, information scientists need to shift their focus from information needs to research practices and the implications of these practices for digital information systems. More fundamentally, the emergence of digital humanities challenges information professionals to transform information systems designed for searching into digital objects that can be explored more freely by the digital humanities community. © Volkmar P.

Data are considered to be the “new oil” making algorithms capable of delivering meaningful information, which makes them more “intelligent.” In this position paper, we review the DIKW pyramid model, shedding a new light on each component. In particular, examining the engineering point of view, we focus on the definition of information, giving it a new conceptual structure. If tradition has always considered information as data-bearing meaning, in this paper, we argue that information is not meaningful. In fact, from the analysis of Shannon’s studies in communication engineering, we highlight how the notion of meaning is not necessary for the definition of information. It follows that we need to explore other paths in order to find a sustainable conceptual theory able to provide a new insight. Therefore, we show how it will not only be necessary to carry out a semiotic revolution to be able to introduce meaning into the communicative act, but it is also necessary to introduce the figure of an interpreting agent. Thanks to the interaction between such interpretative acts, which take place in conscious freedom à la Eco, cultural units emerge. Thus, we should address part of today’s research into new forms of data in order to facilitate a semiotic revolution. In particular, digital humanities and cultural heritage can funnel a new type of data for which semiotic representativeness has a greater degree of quality.

Using the quantitative and qualitative content analysis as a methodological tool, the study of 20 trending YouTube videos was carried out, with the aim of defining the aesthetic-narrative characteristics of these audiovisuals that shape new typologies. It was found that these videos show a predominance of musical content, entertainment vlogs, television content, jokes and experiments with popular products.

The model is based on Linked Open Data technology and seeks to exhaustively represent the most relevant characteristics for the tasks of contextualization of the documentary groupings and units, management, document retrieval, dissemination and sharing of data about the historical photographs. Design/methodology/approach: An OWL ontology, called Ontophoto, was constructed following an adaptation of the methodology proposed by Uschold and Gruninger and Gruninger and Fox. The ontology was implemented using Protégé 5.5 software. Next a Graph DB® graph database application (Ontotext) was created to generate a query system based on the SPARQL language. To validate the consistency and effectiveness of the model and ontology, a competency questions methodology has been applied using a sample from the Skogler photographic archive. Findings: The model facilitates the generation of systems for dissemination and retrieval of iconographic data for historical research, overcoming some of the limitations with respect to the design of methods of content and contextual information representation for heritage photographic archives. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on a sample. Future work should consider the implementation of the model on the totality of a photographic collection. Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive ontological model that allows the creation of distributed systems of knowledge representation, which can be queried through SPARQL language. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities,Image retrieval,Linked Open Data,Ontologies,OWL,Photographic archives,Press photography,Semantic Web,Robledano-Arillo J.,Navarro-Bonilla D.,Cerdá-Díaz J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does it dictate the transition between arguments in a chapter, or the transition between chapters in a book, or the transition between books in the system? This paper suggests that Hegel's method can be seen to work at the level of paragraph composition. It proposes that Hegel's use of a certain form of paragraph is consistent with his account of his method. This use reflects how Hegel conceptualizes thought processes; and it is frequent, employed semi-systematically throughout Hegel's major works. The proposal is substantiated both through a close reading of Hegel's description of his method, and through a quantitative investigation (or ""distant reading"") of Hegel's works. The paper further suggests, and demonstrates, that Hegel's writings can be made more legible if the dialectical structure of his paragraphs is made conspicuous. Moreover, this paper lives at the shadowy fringes between design, the digital humanities, and the history of philosophy. It investigates the ways algorithms and design principles can be used to investigate Hegel's philosophy. © 2020 Johns Hopkins University Press.

On the case of Northern Illinois, we made a simulation of the genesis of the primary network of settlements. The periodization of the settling timeline of the study area is given, the distinctive short-term period in which the simulated processes took place is highlighted. Based on the works on the history of Northern Illinois reclamation, key parameters that influenced the formation of human settlements were identified: vegetation type, relief, hydrography, and the location of mineral deposits. The characteristics of the pre-European landscapes have been converted into components of the favorableness field; a synthetic favorableness field has been modeled. The initial settlement pattern is strongly determined by the characteristics of the underlying landscape. There is a significant correspondence of large and medium-sized settlements to local maximums of the favorableness field, while the location of small settlements is determined by some other factors.

Semantic Structured Representation Method of Narrative Text Based on Plot Ontology,2,10.13530/j.cnki.jlis.2020017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121996496&doi=10.13530%2fj.cnki.jlis.2020017&partnerID=40&md5=840f17b76d0d6c8ed9720949e47794f6,"Narration is the record, deduction and re-creation of the development of the human world. Narrative text is a kind of rich semantic text, which uses symbolic systems such as words and images to represent real or fictional events and plots. Because of the different purposes, styles and genres of the text, it has various kinds and rich contents. The interpretation of narrative texts has always been the core and basic work of humanists. With the rise of digital humanities, a new research paradigm has emerged in the field of Humanities and Social Sciences; with more emphasis on data-driven research methods, the way of understanding narrative texts has changed, and new reading methods and research needs of narrative texts, including strategic reading and distant reading, have emerged. In order to fully meet this demand, structuring, semanticizing and standardizing narrative text content and constructing narrative text data infrastructure adapted to the digital humanities research paradigm have gradually become the key to future work. As a special type of text, the complexity of narrative text lies in its emphasis on events as the basic- component and the core structure. Events and plots all have abundant correlations. Therefore, narrative texts are dynamic and complex. This brings challenges to the full expression of narrative text features, the description of narrative structure, and the realization of semantic structured representation for narrative text. In order to solve the problem, this study started from the basic theory of narratology, summarizes and collates the related statements about events, plots and narratives. Firstly, the characteristics of narrative texts were summarized, and an event knowledge representation scheme for narrative texts was proposed. Followed by the definition of plot, the ontology EBPO (Event Based Plot Ontology, EBPO) was designed and developed. The ontology defines 10 classes and 29 properties, which can express plots and events more clearly. Based on this ontology, a general process of deep semantic annotation oriented to the characteristics of narrative texts was proposed, and a preliminary deep semantic annotation experiment was carried out. In the semantic annotation experiment, five classical novel fragments were selected, such as Pride and Prejudice, Moon and Sixpence, Living, and so on. Natural language processing tool GATE 8.5.1 was used for annotating. With the results of semantic annotation, this paper proposed a hierarchical-network model for narrative texts. Taking Pride and Prejudice, Moon and Sixpence as examples, the annotation results were reorganized and correlated, and the semantic structured representation of narrative texts was realized. The results show that the semantic structured representation of narrative text based on plot ontology can achieve more accurate definition on the events and plots. Bases on EBPO ontology and annotation ontology, the large-scale, high-quality, rich semantic narrative text corpus could be built, so the machine-aided event retrieval and reading methods including plot review, character relationship overview, plot development path can be realized. Future research will focus on the definition of plot, narrative mode, narrative style and other issues in order to achieve more accurate content representation of narrative text. 8 figs. 4 tabs. 61 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

The Heterogeneous Actor-Network of Social Media Research: Reimaging the Production of Knowledge in the Digital Age,0,10.30386/MCR.202004_(143).0004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120436751&doi=10.30386%2fMCR.202004_%28143%29.0004&partnerID=40&md5=8538e846628402cf8b89daf62cb993b2,"This research examines the interdisciplinary practices and collaborations of the social media literature from the perspective of the new materialism. Big data and related digital tools are changing the format of knowledge production among the humanities and social sciences. Moreover, the development of digital sociology and digital humanities shows the clear trend of collaboration between social scientists (or humanists), data scientists, and digital tools. A reflection of this kind of interdisciplinary research focuses mainly on the problem of methods and methodology, but some works also probe epistemological questions. This research instead explores the practices and collaborative processes of knowledge production that involve the interaction among social scientists (or humanists), data scientists, and digital tools. Based on the new materialism, the process is seen as a network assembled by heterogeneous elements including both humans and non-humans. We thus discuss how an interdisciplinary research team is enacted, how researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds collaborate with each other, and how digital tools as non-human actors act and interact with researchers? The discussion is based on two cases of social media research teams in Taiwan. In the end, we argue that, before judging the digital tool, no matter as “a favor” or as “a burden”, one must reconsider the whole process of knowledge production by treating it as a hybrid network assembled by heterogeneous activities. In this way, we are able to know more about the relationships among different “actors” and what they actually do, hence making the knowledge production of this digital era even more solid. © 2020 National Chengchi University.

An “open lab?” the electronic textual cultures lab in the evolving digital humanities landscape,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85120361917&partnerID=40&md5=dd2a0125566b53a1013c53a109ad3107,"As the scholarly landscape evolves into a more “open” plain, so do the shapes of institutions, labs, centres, and other places and spaces of research, including those of the digital humanities (DH). The continuing success of such research largely depends on a commitment to open access and open source philosophies that broaden opportunities for a more efficient, productive, and universal design and use of knowledge. The Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory (ETCL; etcl.uvic.ca) is a collaborative centre for digital and open scholarly practices at the University of Victoria, Canada, that engages with these transformations in knowledge creation through its umbrella organization, the Canadian Social Knowledge Institute (C-SKI), that coordinates and supports open social scholarship activities across three major initiatives: The ETCL itself, the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI; dhsi.org), and the Implementing New Knowledge Environments (INKE; inke.ca) Partnership, including sub-projects associated with each. Open social scholarship is the practice of creating and disseminating public-facing scholarship through accessible means. Working through C-SKI, we seek ways to engage communities more widely with publicly funded humanities scholarship, such as through research creation and dissemination, mentorship, and skills training. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

We argue that the “situatedness” of DH labs extends beyond physical/institutional space and includes also epistemic, political, sociological, and disciplinary issues. To explore this, we first outline the constructivist model of laboratory knowledge practices developed through feminist laboratory studies, and how that model’s focus on the laboratory as a producer of research subjects, rather than a container for them, runs counter to narratives about laboratories in DH. We then show how DH labs produce research objects, research subjects, epistemic context, and disciplinary legitimacy. Finally, we present the case of the Tactical Humanities Lab (THL) at Rensselaer, a DH lab situated through Science & Technology Studies and housed within an engineering-centered institute. Through the highlighting of two student-led projects, we show how THL knowledge workers navigate issues of our own identity, the boundaries of STS and DH, the practice of social justice through DH, and the social construction of the boundaries of laboratory work. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

It is based on the assumption that the manner in which the knowledgetransfer activities of DH communities are facilitated affects the knowledge they produce. Following an analysis of eight semi-structured interviews of directors, researchers, and administrators, the article considers how DH professionals describe the facilitation of the interdisciplinary transfer of knowledge in DH centers. It demonstrates that the transfer of knowledge in DH centers is based on overlapping layers of organic networks and stable organizational structures that support various kinds of knowledge-sharing practices. The transfer of knowledge in DH centers combines the exchange of ideas in the same physical space with online communication at various levels, ranging from outside academia to the internal communication of a research group. Further, the factors that enable information flow also have the capability to restrict potentially meaningful information from entering into the field. As a result, this article suggests that it is important to continue the discussion on the boundaries for the transfer of knowledge in DH. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Marcas de fuego (fire brands) are burned imprints made with a heated iron instrument that capture the distinctive seal of a book’s owner on one or several of the volume’s edges. The use of marcas de fuego to claim ownership over books proliferated mainly in conventual libraries during the Colonial period in Mexico. The first priority of CCMF was to go online with an initial selection of 120 marcas de fuego from various convents, institutions, and individuals, in order to show the variety of provenance that can be found in the print and manuscript collections of colonial libraries. Arriving at this first stage of the project did not present exceptional complications since it started as a collaboration between only two institutions. As other libraries joined, however, it became necessary to work systematically to standardize provenance as well as the names of authors. The complexities of standardization and international collaboration are examined in this article, as well as our experiences trying to make the catalog a reliable instrument for other institutions that hold books that bear marcas de fuego. This article considers the inception and development of the project to date, looking in particular at the experience of coordinating the efforts of multiple institutions in different countries.

The real story is much more complicated: emerging through a combination of institutional risk-taking and serendipitous accident, the lab was — and remains — an example of how conventional definitions of a “laboratory,” and particularly the rather fraught label of “humanities lab,” often come short of capturing the true cross-disciplinary nature of this type of work. More than any academic or methodological template, the DHLC lab emerged through the curiosity and enthusiasm of the students who inhabit it. For that reason, this case study — a brief history of the DHLC’s development, cultural practices, and ongoing work — has been written collaboratively with multiple voices, including the lab director (Natalie Phillips) and the student researchers. Together, we describe the challenges and opportunities created by embarking on a radically interdisciplinary research effort. We report the elements that enabled the DHLC lab to find success through a willingness to abandon expectations and adapt to rapidly evolving research practices, while maintaining our core focus on the humanities. We hope this case study proves useful for those who, like us, seek to explore the vast potential of interdisciplinary lab space for DH practice, the pedagogical benefits of collaborative research, and how to prioritize humanities in a STEM-focused world. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Ticha is an online digital text explorer that provides access to images, transcriptions, analysis, and translations of the Colonial Zapotec texts. The Ticha project includes in-person workshops with Zapotec community members as part of an iterative development process. Feedback from these interactions inform design decisions for the project.

Profits from sale of Ooligan Press books sustain the lab, which would collapse if its books were steadily unprofitable. Second, the essay uses the DH feminism “M.E.A.L.S.” framework to explain how Ooligan's horizontal management structure and student ownership of the press manifest in an ethic of care. Unlike most R-1 DH labs, where priorities are set by senior scholars and directors, graduate students decide which projects the lab will develop, and which skills they want to master in exchange for their labor.

An Action Research on User Experience Optimization of the Crowdsourcing Transcription Platform in Digital Humanities: A Socio-Technical System Theory Perspective,1,10.13530/j.cnki.jlis.2020042,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85115299381&doi=10.13530%2fj.cnki.jlis.2020042&partnerID=40&md5=658d963190b47ddf15080c635d481566,"Digital humanity is an emerging interdisciplinary research field that integrates advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) into traditional humanities research. As the infrastructure of digital humanities, ICT - enabled digital platforms play vital roles in facilitating the resource preservation, data curation, information integration, and knowledge management of digital artifacts, which may further lead to the development of digital humanities research and build an interconnected digital ecosystem. In other words, the theory development and practical application of digital humanities rely on the platform design and implementation, which may in turn call for more attention to the data infrastructure and digital strategies. To date, the existing platforms on digital humanities are to some extent, limited by the bottlenecks of ICTs. Meanwhile, digital humanities platforms pay less attention to the real needs and requirements of humanities scholars. In this regard, the actual usage, satisfaction rate, and sustainability of digital humanities platforms are far from satisfactory. Therefore, the user experience design in an iterative way of digital humanities platforms is worthy of further investigation. On the basis of the socio-technical system theory, this paper conducts an action research to improve the user experience of crowdsourcing transcription platforms with a particular focus on the Sheng Xuanhuai manuscript transcription developed by the Shanghai Library. The action research goes through three cycles of design iterations, including functional optimization, interactive optimization, and personalized optimization. The first stage mainly focuses on testing and optimizing the key functionalities of the platform, including database debugging, the management function, the release function, and the transcription function. In the second stage, the underlying functional problems of the platform are identified and improved. Meanwhile, interaction and optimization are also conducted on several fundamental components, such as information retrieval, click and response time, etc. The purpose is to enhance the use efficiency of the platform. In the third stage, more university students from different disciplines are recruited to conduct an extensive user study on the optimization of personalization requirements, to meet the needs of individual users and to improve the satisfaction of target users. From the evolvement of the three cycles, the focal point of the research has shifted from the technical perspective to the human-technology interaction perspective, covering the three key user experience dimensions, namely functional experience, interactive experience, and emotional experience. To this end, the personalized needs and volunteer experience are better satisfied. In terms of the theoretical contribution, the study presents a conceptual framework on user experience design for crowdsourcing platforms in digital humanities from the technology and social perspective, enriching three building-blocks of digital humanities projects, namely the platform, the task, and the volunteer. In terms of the practical implications, the study sheds light on the user experience design of crowdsourcing transcription platforms and provides valuable guidance on how to align the development of digital humanities crowdsourcing platform with the need of the social systems. This study also has some limitations. Firstly, due to the role duality, some participants are both platform designers/managers and team members for action research, which may lead to the some bias of the action because of the subjective judgment of the participants. Secondly, constrained by realistic conditions such as technology and time, the platform still has some user experience issues. Thirdly, the study is only aimed at crowdsourcing transcription of digital humanities projects, and the generalization and applicability of its conclusions need to be further examined.

The ethics of studying digital contexts: Reflections from three empirical case studies,2,10.1002/hbe2.183,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108225792&doi=10.1002%2fhbe2.183&partnerID=40&md5=af5cb7d57d9089d68b41c738d31f66ab,"The purpose of this article is to highlight important research-related ethical issues and provide researchers with guiding questions for producing ethical research of digital contexts. We also suggest that research ethics can be understood as a bridge between the seemingly distinct subfields across digital media studies. The article discusses three empirical case studies that reflect three main subfields and three research methodologies—ethnography and cultural media studies, critical discourse analysis and digital humanities, and user experience (UX) methods and mobile media studies. These cases critically engage with three main ethical issues related to digital media research: Privacy, ownership, and compensation. Based on the ethical dimensions discussed through the three case studies, the article inductively articulates a set of questions pertaining to research data and to the relationship between the researcher and the user/participant of digital media. These can help facilitate more scholarly collaborations and wider conversations between academic silos in the field of digital media studies, and lead an ethical internet research. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Compensation,Digital ethnography,Lurking,Ownership,Privacy,Rating,Research ethics,Solidarity,Yadlin-Segal A.,Tsuria R.,Bellar W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lab and slack. Situated research practices in digital humanities-introduction to the dhq special issue,2,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85108051973&partnerID=40&md5=eee141cc4a673e5bacc3eb8e14e3ed0a,"Although the concept of digital comes with an assumption of placelessness and detachment from physical space and geographical location, these matters still play a significant role in the way the digital humanities research is practiced today, and also in the future. The location, the surroundings and infrastructure open the questions of accessibility and equality: space shapes the opportunities for doing digital humanities research, both enables and hinders collaboration, and both unifies and divides scholars. The purpose of this special issue is to examine the different aspects of situated research practices of the digital humanities covering two perspectives: physical and virtual. The physical places of research refer to the various digital humanities sites (laboratories, centers, departments) all over the world and more widely to the surroundings a location in a particular city, country, cultural sphere or continent affecting research practices. As virtual environments of digital humanities scholarship, we define the digital internet-based platforms, services, and tools that enable research and scholarly collaboration. The aspects that determine digital humanities research in both physical and virtual places are infrastructure (material and non-material), social interaction (communication and collaboration), and context (social, cultural, and political situatedness). The aspects influence each other and changes in one of them can affect the others. They have also impact on what is studied, the ways research can be done, and, in the end the results of our knowledge, what kind of knowledge digital humanities research can provide. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

For example, DAH has the potential to shift the discipline's focus from the traditional topics of inquiry to less explored aspects of the field-in short, to reposition the discipline's central preoccupations with the issues of patronage, which are the concerns of the elite, to broader structures at work in a society, including the experiences of the marginalized. This displacement from center to periphery is not restricted to DAH research questions, but often applies to other aspects of DAH as well: To its status within the Digital Humanities (DH); to the demographic it frequently attracts; and to the infrastructure(s) developed to support it. Yet despite this potential, in many respects DAH occupies the periphery. This essay problematizes these issues as crystallized by the establishment of a digital art history lab at a privately funded library that serves the public, and explores one instance of how DAH has forced the North American academy to reflect further on the issues of privilege, access, and the future of art history. © 2020 Institute of Art History.

The fold: Rethinking interactivity in data visualization,3,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85106662275&partnerID=40&md5=9e7356288ecc167a64a72ee78baeebf1,"We propose the philosophical notion of the fold as an evocative vocabulary for the design and critique of interactive data visualizations. An expanding range of application areas, such as digital art history and literary studies, illustrates the potential of data visualization for research and education in the humanities. Coinciding with the increasing currency of data as evidence in the humanities, this research addresses a growing interest in data visualization for visual analysis and argumentation. For example, cultural collection visualizations promise a range of possibilities for visual and interactive representations of digital cultural heritage, used both for free exploration and focused research. Based on the concept of the fold, prominently advanced by Gilles Deleuze, this paper outlines a critical framework that draws attention towards the complexity of the underlying data. The fold offers a way to analyze and conceptualize visualizations through the lens of three integrated operations: Explication, implication, and complication. It is an opportunity to think of interactive visualizations as portals into coherent, elastic, and ultimately infinite information spaces. Accordingly, it rejects the separation between interactivity and visual encoding and draws attention to the transitions between multiple states of a visualization. We identify design patterns of the fold in data visualizations, devise a framework for the critical interpretation of interactivity in data visualization, and demonstrate the implications for the digital humanities. © 2020, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Trevor Paglen (2019) coins the notion of “invisible images” in order to define those images that inhabit this new ecosystem of vision machines in which images are produced by machines and for machines. In this new context, the traditional concepts that have defined our understanding of images become obsolete. This demands new concepts to think visual phenomena beyond the humanist domain of representation. This article attempts a twofold task. First, it argues that Simondon’s “allagmatic” method (2015) offers a fruitful ground for a post-representational study of invisible images. Second, it shows that if we adopt the “allagmatic” viewpoint, we surpass the domain of the humanities in which the study of images has been traditionally framed (Panofsky, 1987). The final section suggests that this new approach is closer to the critical post-humanities (Braidotti, 2018) than to the digital humanities (Berry, 2012). © 2020 Universidad Diego Portales.

The number often represents the stable, rational and literally calculable super-sign, while the word is associated with impermanence and indeterminacy. When the digital humanities convert texts into tables, they assume that more reliable and well-founded statements about literature can be made on the basis of numbers. But this conviction overlooks the fact that literature itself has written an extensive history of miscalculation. Indeed, literature counters the rampant numerical compulsion with an alternative - number dissidence.

The concept of digital humanities established in the world is revealed, a positive experience of creating a digital resources of documentary cultural heritage in the scientific libraries of Ukraine through integration of methods of technical and humanities sciences as a product of a new intellectual quality. Conclusions. The scope of the concept and subject area of digital humanities are still evolving from specific forms of restricting of resource creation to the widespread penetration of digital technologies in preparation and implementation of humanitarian research, based on the development of integrated technologies. It is evident by the studies of Western researchers M. Thaller, M. Terras, E. Vanhoutt, Olivier Le Deuff, J. Flanders, T. Weller and others.

Cyberspace and new technologies in cultural institutions provide up-to-date information to their public that has the potential of acting as a co-author by creating and sharing. Accessing cultural information of the museum's collection online through the screen or electronic device is a global trend and leads individuals to interact, exchange knowledge and absorb social change.

Can you imagine that everyone will migrate to digital on equal terms, including the population most vulnerable to poverty? Are digital educational resources within easy reach of the entire student community? Do all families have sufficient digital literacy and financial conditions to assist and enable their children to access and use digital tools? The answers seem obvious.

It introduces a novel method to creating test collections from smaller subsets. This method is based on what we will introduce as distant supervision' and will allow us to improve computational modelling in the digital humanities by including new methods of supervised learning. Using recurrent neural networks, we generated a training corpus and were able to train a highly accurate model that qualitatively and quantitatively improved a baseline model. To demonstrate our new approach experimentally, we employ a real-life research question based on existing humanities collections. We use neural network based sentiment analysis to decode Holocaust memories and present a methodology to combine supervised and unsupervised sentiment analysis to analyse the oral history interviews of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Finally, we employed three advanced methods of computational semantics. These helped us decipher the decisions by the neural network and understand, for instance, the complex sentiments around family memories in the testimonies. © The Author(s) 2019.

To do this, we used the Internet Archive's Wayback machine to investigate the original presentation and all subsequent changes to the interfaces of a small sample of projects. The study addresses the following questions: What can we learn from a study of interfaces to DH material? How have interfaces to DH materials changed over the course of their existence? Do these changes affect the way the resource is used, and the way it conveys meaning? Should we preserve interfaces for future scholarship? We show that a valuable information may be derived from the interfaces of long-lived projects. Visual design can communicate subtle messages about the way the resource was originally conceived by its creators and subsequent changes show how knowledge of user behaviour developed in the DH community. Interfaces provide information about the intellectual context of early digital projects. They can also provide information about the changing place of DH projects in local and national infrastructures, and the way that projects have sought to survive in challenging funding environments. © The Author(s) 2019.

A case study protocol for meta-research into digital practices in the humanities,2,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85100796421&partnerID=40&md5=7befd58971349907f26cf56533ed03a2,"This paper presents a multicase study protocol for meta-research in Digital Humanities, prepared by Digital Methods and Practices Observatory (DiMPO) Working Group of the Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities in Europe (DARIAH). The protocol is intended to help researchers in conducting meta-research and adopting this methodology for different purposes, disciplines and approaches. As many of the issues raised here are already covered in manuals for social research, our focus is the specificity of meta-research in the DH environment. The specificity of DH in this respect relies on an intrinsic challenge of bringing together generally undertheorised approaches of the humanities with very formal and process-driven ICT approaches. The main assumption behind this research is that a meaningful change in scholarly practices is taking place and is worth investigating. Moreover, a full assessment of this transformation should not focus exclusively on pioneering research, but rather on the selective uptake of digital practices and methods by researchers in the humanities: Those who do not necessarily affiliate themselves with DH but simply use digital tools to explore particular problems. Hence, this paper should be of interest not only to researchers willing to conduct meta analysis, but to all DH practitioners willing to gain critical perspective on their work, as well as for those working on funding, evaluation and research policy. Three pilot studies are discussed in this paper, as they served as a basis for the protocol.

Where conditions for reporting are already limited because of ongoing conflict, both international agency coverage and governmental sources represent crucial conduits for dissemination of information worldwide. This research develops a practice-based lens to examine the embodied, geographic, and temporal networks of media production practices through a multilingual database comparison of French, Russian, American, and British newswire coverage of major military campaigns. Mapping shifts between on-the-ground reporting and dislocated geopolitical coverage against the temporal unfolding of event coverage reveals a new typology: the premediated media event.

However, the short lifespan of online data poses serious challenges for preserving and safeguarding this digital heritage. Not preserving web content would leave a considerable gap in the Belgian historical record. To tackle this challenge, web preservation needs to be addressed on the national level as a cultural and historical necessity, which is why the PROMISE research project (2017–2019) was initiated. As Federal Scientific Institutions (FSI) specialised in heritage preservation, the Royal Library of Belgium and the National Archives partnered with the Universities of Ghent and Namur and the university college Bruxelles-Brabant to bring together their expertise in IT, law, information science and digital humanities to study web archiving. The web archiving strategy resulting from this research project is presented in this article comprising the different phases of the web archiving process, the legal framework, a stakeholder analysis and cost calculation for the different web archiving scenarios. © 2020, Brepols Publishers.

The authors came to the conclusion that, in the conceptualization of a digital environmental activism, researchers place emphasis either on the features of the digital technologies that drive such activity, or on the basis of the environmental mobilization itself. In this work, combining both approaches with digital environmental activism, the authors understand the voluntary collective activity around common environmental interests and values that are implemented publicly and voluntarily through the use of new informational and communication technologies. The article discusses the main features of digital environmental activism, which include, on the one hand, the enhancement of environmental knowledge, and the change in the paradigm of interaction between actors in which they become not only consumers of information, but also its active producers. On the other hand, digital practices contribute to the alienation of users from the real protest movement by limiting them to virtual means of interaction; additionally, this form of participation is not accessible to all citizens, thereby generating new forms of digital inequality and social distances. The authors examined various types of digital participation which include clicktivism, meta-voting, self-affirmation, e-finance, political consumer protection, digital petitions, botivism, data activity, and hacktivism. The authors critically assess both established and new theoretical approaches to the study of digital eco-activism such as Castells’ theory of network society, deliberative democracy, “citizen science”, socio-psychological theories to explain environmental behavior, and Digital Environmental Humanities. The author’s vision of possible options for data synthesis in the study of environmental online activism for the Russian scientific context is proposed. © 2020, RUSSIAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW.

Design/methodology/approach: After a systematic review of semantic data models for organizing cultural heritage images and a comparative analysis of the concept and characteristics of deep semantic annotation (DSA) and indexing, an integrated DSA framework for cultural heritage images as well as its principles and process was designed. Two experiments were conducted on two mural images from the Mogao Caves to evaluate the DSA framework's validity based on four criteria: depth, breadth, granularity and relation. Findings: Results showed the proposed DSA framework included not only image metadata but also represented the storyline contained in the images by integrating domain terminology, ontology, thesaurus, taxonomy and natural language description into a multilevel structure. Originality/value: DSA can reveal the aboutness, ofness and isness information contained within images, which can thus meet the demand for semantic enrichment and retrieval of cultural heritage images at a fine-grained level. This method can also help contribute to building a novel infrastructure for the increasing scholarship of digital humanities. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cultural heritage,Deep semantic annotation,Dunhuang murals,Information modeling,Narrative image,,,,Wang X.,Song N.,Liu X.,Xu L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Social networks, mobile applications, digital trac-es, virtual spaces, and much more either become an independent object of research or turn out to be inextricably linked to the “material” everyday life. But digital technologies require the formation of new skills (for example, digital literacy) for different stages of working with data – from their collection and processing to interpretation. Besides, disciplinary boundaries, methodological principles, and a general approach to research design are being rethought in connection with the proliferation of digital practices.

Recent scholarship has documented significant problems with those sources of knowledge that the public relies on the most, including instances of ideological and algorithmic bias in Wikipedia and Google. Such observations raise the question of how deep one would actu-ally need to dig into these platforms’ representations of factual (historical and biographical) knowledge before encountering similar epistemological issues. The present article addresses this question by ‘nitpicking’ knowledge representations of governments and governmental leadership in Wikipedia and Wikidata. Situated within the emerging framework of ‘data studies’, our micro-level analysis of the representations of Belgian prime ministers and their governments thereby reveals problems of classification, naming and linking of biographical items that go well beyond the affordances of the platforms under discussion. This article thus makes an evidence-based contribution to the study of the fundamental challenges that mark the for-malisation of knowledge in the humanities. © 2020, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

A long and emotional criminal trial followed. Since then, several literary and artistic works inspired by Gisberta’s life and tragic death have emerged in both Portugal and Brazil. In the present article, I argue first that these works are intertextually related; I then show how they are connected through a contemporary artistic, social, and political ecology.

One of the characteristics that differentiates this study from previous approaches is the information used to carry out the research. It combines large datasets of publicly available data from trusted sources with a handpicked selection of records grouping information scattered over the Web. Most of the evidence detected by other studies has been numerically confirmed. At the same time, the new metrics and values established constitute a reference base for monitoring the future evolution of the discipline, and thus favour comparisons. Half of the researchers were found to be affiliated to only nine institutions, whereas the other half of them were scattered across 84 locations. Department affi-liation showed a varied pattern of the different degrees of specialization in each institution. Although the major historic role played by Philology was confirmed, the rising interest of other areas of the Humanities and Social Science produces a wider picture, which helped to identify five large clusters of research topics, centred on major disciplines. The quantitative analysis of funding, a dimension almost unexplored in the Humanities, proved to be a valuable way to assess the discipline and its historical evolution. In fact, it revealed interesting trends that led to our proposal of a three-phase periodization in the consolidation of digital humanities in Spain. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations regarding how to deal with issues that could harm the future development of this research area and the role that Spanish researchers can play in the international context. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

It uses publication networks to show how the study of comparative educational history facilitated the international circulation of knowledge in the teaching profession, and how the “uses” of educational history were shaped by larger geopolitical forces. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes the international exchange of texts between normal schools in China and Japan and, subsequently, between normal schools in China and the United States. A database of 107 publications in the field of western educational history that were adopted in China reveals specific patterns of textual citation, cross-reference, and canon-formation in the field of educational historiography. Findings: With conclusions derived from a combination of social network analysis and clustering analysis, this paper identifies three broad stages in China's development of normal-school curricula in comparative educational history: “Japan as Teacher,” “transitional period” and “America as Teacher.” Research limitations/implications: Statistical analysis can reveal citation and reference patterns but not readers' understanding of the deeper meaning of texts – in this case, textbooks on the subject of western educational history. In addition, the types of publications analyzed in this study are relatively limited, the articles on the history of education in journals have not become the main objects of this study.

To prepare students for this technological future, Saudi institutions of higher education must develop humanities courses capable of exploring complex humantechnology relations. This article begins to respond to this need by developing a project-based digital humanities pedagogy that synthesizes Don Ihde’s post–phenomenology of human- technology relations with Michael Polanyi’s model of tacit knowing. The pedagogy emphasizes the interiorizing of machine and symbolic (literary and rhetorical) technology through apprenticeship projects in the digital humanities classroom. We argue that a synthesis of Ihde’s philosophy of technology and Polanyi’s tacit knowing provides the conceptually rich framework needed to discuss and critically reflect on curricula, syllabi, and classroom projects that prepare students for their future technology lifeworlds. The conceptual framework developed serves as a basis for developing future digital humanities courses in higher education in Saudi Arabia. The researchers develop the conceptual framework by creating a taxonomy of Ihde’s key post-phenomenological concepts, synthesizing his concepts with Polanyi’s tacit knowing, and using the synthesized taxonomy to analyze and describe the human-technology relations used to complete individual projects of digital expression. © 2020, Common Ground Research Networks, Melvin Hall, Orchida Fayez, All Rights Reserved.",Digital Humanities Project-Based Digital Pedagogy,Don Ihde Post-Phenomenology,Focal and Subsidiary Awareness,Michael Polanyi Tacit Knowing,Multistability,Symbolic and Machine Technology,,,Hall M.,Fayez O.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ulrich Schneider lists 148 original works in the history of philosophy by 114 authors pub-lished from 1810 through 1899. The scale of this historiographic tradition makes it suitable for analysis through digital humanities techniques (“distant reading,” formal analysis, and innovative visualizations). This paper uses that body of publications to show how the canon of the history of German philosophy in the 19th century was formed and how it evolved. In order to uncover patterns in the attention devoted to particular 19th century philosophers, the authors undertook a formal analysis of 77 tables of contents from German textbooks in the history of philosophy. They used the results of their analysis to classify philosophers into three groups with metaphorical labels drawn from ecology: dominant, subdominant, and recedent. In addition to confirming the dom-inance of the “Big Four” (Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel), the analysis provides a more nuanced picture of the period under consideration. For example, during the 1830s and 1840s, opinions about the significance of certain philosophers became highly polarized. In some textbooks Johann Friedrich Herbart was completely ignored, while in others his ideas were explored in more pages than those of Hegel. Kant’s writings attracted increasing attention after 1860. His share of pages increased as the number devoted to most other philosophers was dwindling. Fichte, Schelling and Hegel lose nearly half of their pages and fall closer to the subdominant category that included Herbart, Schleiermacher, and Schopenhauer. Original visualization techniques provide a graphical representation of the changes in the canon of 19th century German philosophy. © 2020, Gaidar Institute Press.

Digital queer: Tracing the digital discourse around section 377 of the indian penal code,0,10.16995/DSCN.326,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096235654&doi=10.16995%2fDSCN.326&partnerID=40&md5=b3564ac0edee1f3de4fc49138abbef16,"Social Media and Digital Activism, in the context of the Global South, have continued to redefine identities and transform traditional notions of citizenship, nationhood, and belonging. With the power of digital technologies to bring public and private issues to light, digital cultures have enabled the shaping of contemporary faces of entire nations in the South. The most potent example of how digital activism and new age digital cultures have helped chisel a South Asian queer identity in India and beyond is Section 377, an archaic, colonial law, established in the country by the British Raj, and that until August 2018, criminalized homosexuality as ""carnal intercourse"" or an ""unnatural sexual act."" Although not applicable specifically to homosexuals, it is widely perceived as an anti-queer law in the country; cloaked in colonial textual ambiguity, it directs the colonial desire for sexual control towards colonial societies. This research focuses on an exploration of Indian queer dissident subaltern counterpublics, and how these communities (both members and non-members) congregate on Twitter to combat postcolonial and Victorian structures through new media as a decolonizing and transnational space. Therefore, the hashtags surrounding this event perform and decolonize Indian cyberspaces. The study equally investigates how the new wave of digital activism post reading down of the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code has fortified identities of the marginalized and the non-marginalized alike and transformed the notion of the ""self"" and the ""other."" Given this premise, this paper employs Twitter Search API to collect and filter tweets that explore the private and public discourses of a digital movement that has proved instrumental in the creation of digital spaces for the marginalized ""other."" This body of work contributes to the pool of research that is focused on the understanding of South Asian digital identities and the creation of their digital spaces as a solution for social, legal, and political discrimination. © 2020 Carl Hanser Verlag.

Novel circular graph capabilities for comprehensive visual analytics of interconnected data in digital humanities,6,10.26583/sv.12.4.06,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85096147376&doi=10.26583%2fsv.12.4.06&partnerID=40&md5=92776a828a7ab6d70ee87aa408f6e4a4,"The paper is devoted to the development of tools, which enable to improve the compre-hensive power of visual analytics of interconnected data. This kind of data is a great challenge for researchers in the field of Digital Humanities. We propose using ontology-driven SciVi visual analytics platform to tackle this challenge and help researchers to bring data to life. The proposed analytics components are based on the circular graph, representing the da-ta elements as the circle distributed nodes and the data elements' connections as the cubic parabolas' arcs. SciVi platform provides not only the traditional interactive means for graph visual analytics, such as node searching based on regular expressions, highlighting of incident edges and connected nodes by mouse hover, depicting clusters by colors, threshold-based fil-tering of weighted nodes and edges, etc., but also a set of new features, which help to solve special analytics tasks. The paper presents these novel features and corresponding use cases. First, we propose an ontology-driven data extraction, transformation and loading mecha-nism that allows obtaining the input data from different sources and preprocessing them by custom algorithms defined by means of high-level visual programming language. Second, we developed a multilevel ring scale that is placed around the circular graph allowing to group the graph nodes according to the given classifier and automatically reorder them at runtime. Third, we demonstrate an implementation of the equalizing filter that allows applying differ-ent filtering thresholds to different groups of graph nodes/edges to cut off the noisy data. This is necessary for data wrangling in the case the data noise has a non-uniform strength distri-bution across the graph. Fourth, we developed a graph state calculator that allows data com-parison by performing different operations like union, intersection, etc. on the data slices shown within the graph. Fifth, we make it possible to synchronize the data slice currently vis-ualized by the graph with the corresponding localized area on the geographical map. Thanks to the features presented, the SciVi advanced interactive tools can harness the power of visual analytics in Digital Humanities and Big Data. © 2020 National Research Nuclear University.

CAPTCHA, and its many derivatives, are presented as content identification mechanisms: the user is asked to identify content in order for the computer to determine the identity of the user. This twofold process of content identification, however, has evolved significantly since CAPTCHA’s inception in the late 1990s. Pivoting away from a realist framework, largely dependent on the standard tenets [of] cryptography, toward a relational framework premised on aesthetic contingency and social consensus, CAPTCHA’s arc uniquely illustrates how contested notions of both “content” and “identity” become materialized in contemporary internet infrastructure. Inspired by Walter Benjamin’s exegetical study of early photography, this critical historicization aims to foreground CAPTCHA as a particularly fraught juncture of humans and computers, which, as with Benjamin’s intervention, productively troubles received ideas of humanism and automation, mediation and materiality. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",artificial intelligence,CAPTCHA,cryptography,cybersecurity,digital humanities,reCAPTCHA,spam,,Justie B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SNA can be defined as the application of the graph theory to the problem of modelling and analysing social structures. The network paradigm stresses the importance of relational aspects in history and it fits very well into pre-modernmentality and social practices. In a weakly institutionalised face-to-face society, social entanglements and interactions were absolutely crucial. Today, the development of modern computer technology and the ubiquity of the World Wide Web as well as social networks such as Facebook promote the application of this research paradigm. The article alludes to recent research contributions and discusses frequent methodological objections against the use of SNA in medievalandearlymodernhistory studies. In a second step, medievalnetwork thinking and networking strategieswhich can be found for instance in genealogical sources and humanistic exchange of letters are discussed as possible objects of historical network research. Finally, a preliminary case study demonstrates how techniques of Text Mining and SNA can be applied to the investigation of late medieval Vatican registers, providing new insights into the money transfer (payment of annates) betweenGermany and Rome during the pontificate of Pope Sixtus IV.

This collection contains approximately 1.95 million pages in Finnish and Swedish. The Finnish part of the collection consists of about 2.40 billion words. The National Library’s Digital Collections are offered via the digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi web service, also known as Digi. An open data package of the whole collection was released in early 2017 (Pääkkönen et al. 2016). Quality of OCRed collections is an important topic in digital humanities, as it affects general usability and searchability of collections. There is no single available method to assess quality of large collections, but different methods can be used to approximate quality. This paper discusses different corpus analysis style methods to approximate overall lexical quality of the Finnish part of the Digi collection. Methods include usage of parallel samples and word error rates, usage of morphological analysers, frequency analysis of words and comparisons to comparable edited lexical data.

The prediction of learning outcomes plays an important role in professional training of the future civil engineers. The relevance of the article lies in the lack of a unified approach to predicting the formation of basic professional competencies among students of civil engineering universities. The purpose of the article is to describe the creation of a technology for predicting the formation of professional competencies of future civil engineers using modern computer technologies. Materials and Methods. The study was carried out on the basis of the results of the analysis of publications on the creation of social and pedagogical forecasts by computer methods, followed by the construction of “competence-based profiles”. To study the problem, empirical information from the results of passed examinations, tests performed by students of the academic programme 03/08/01 “Construction engineering” (102 students) was analysed. The data were presented in a 3D OLAP cube format. Results. As a result of the research, the author has created a step-by-step technology for quantitative forecasting of the formation of general professional, professional and universal competencies of future civil engineers, in accordance with the educational standard. A competence-based profile of a student enrolled with the construction engineering university has been built. Donbass National Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture served as experimental facility. The analytical tool “Competence calculator of a future civil engineer” was developed. The optimal time for forecast development was revealed: making a forecast at the early stages of training while maintaining sufficient accuracy. Discussion and Conclusion. The results of the study open a new theoretical direction in the study of the influence of various factors on the results of pedagogical forecasting: identifying the dynamics of achieving each of the educational results in each of the academic semesters; study of factors and indicators of the forecast background. © 2020 National Research Ogarev Mordovia State University.

The recent human resources scandal (the Rikunabi case) in Japan has made stakeholders to realise the importance of the basic philosophy of data protection. Convention 108+ declared ‘human dignity’ to prohibit an instrumental treatment of individuals in processing personal data, and thereby, in a positive sense, place the human in the centre of data processing cycle. Although there is no concept equivalent to ‘human dignity’ under the Japanese data protection laws, due to social norms in Japan, the human-centric approach is supported by recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) guidelines in Japan. The basic idea of the relationship between humans and machines is universal, even if the laws are local, in bridging the different legal regimes. The promise of Convention 108+ seems to take the processing of massive volumes of personal data, sorting out the individuals, and standardising the personality as its specific targets, and the defence of digital humanity as its noble ideal. In this sense, Convention 108+ has a universal value with its human dignity. © 2020 Hiroshi Miyashita",Artificial intelligence,Convention 108+,Human dignity,Human-centric data protection,Japanese data protection laws,,,,Miyashita H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expanding existing historical scholarship, which has focused on elite families individually, the article opens up a broader perspective by investigating Taiwanese elites as a social group, albeit a heterogeneous one. Based on a dataset comprising family members and their relationships, the article first describes this marital network of 1,271 families. Subsequently, following a Bourdieusian approach, it analyses distinct elite groups and their engagement in multiple fields of activity, information about which is stored in TBIO (Taiwan Biographical Ontology), a biographical database established by the author. The analysis reveals the existence of characteristic combinations of capital—dubbed here ‘portfolios of prestige’—which allowed these families to gain and maintain their positions of influence. In combining Digital Humanities methods and sociological approaches, the article thus identifies salient structural features of Taiwanese elites which have rarely been highlighted and opens up new prospects for future research. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020",Digital Humanities,Elite studies,Japanese colonial period,Positional analysis,Post-war period,Social Network Analysis,Taiwan,,Dluhošová T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These uses of science fiction as a source that is expected to reflect public interests are undermined if the examples employed by researchers are interpreted differently by the intended audience or beneficiaries of research. We surveyed the public to identify their definitions and discovered a categorization based on clearly defined features. These align with some academic theories but differ from postmodern approaches as the analysis suggests science fiction can be defined categorically. The empirical survey data are consistent and demonstrate an unmistakable distinction between popular definitions of science fiction and fantasy. Our theoretical analysis implies some definitions may be confused by evaluating secondary “fuzzy” characteristics as if they were fundamental features of the genre. We suggest Wittgenstein’s family resemblances, between subjects associated with the genre at any specific time, should be interpreted as an ephemeral grouping validated by correlation with enduring core features, rather than definitive. On the basis of the common themes identified from the survey responses and a critique of existing genre models, we suggest the classical concept of techne may best describe the empirical essence of science fiction.

The first section investigates three discourses that gave rise to the emergence of a laboratory in the humanities: the transformation of the humanities infrastructure within the university, paradigm shifts in the social sciences, and the expansion of cultural categories of innovation, the maker movement (the proliferation of makerspaces), and the idea of community. Next, the author presents a history of the laboratory in the humanities and determines the shift from a laboratory as a physical place to conceptual laboratory. The last section analyses five models for humanities labs based on laboratories’ statements and operations: the center-type lab, the techno-science lab, the work station-type lab, the social challenges-centric lab, and virtual lab. The research shows that the laboratory turn has emerged in the humanities as a part of a wider process of the laboratorization of social life, which has been occurring since the 1980s.

I consider Lovelace’s algorithms through the framework of poetics, that is, how meaning is made and materialized through symbolic inscription. Within the discursive contexts of industrial manufacturing and Romanticism, I find that an algorithmic mode of production emerges from the consideration and inscription of memory. Since the ramifications of inscription and memory echo throughout contemporary computing and the Digital Humanities, examining the logics and paradigms that computational inscriptions reproduce are increasingly vital today. Thus I ultimately argue for the poetic analyses of algorithms and computer code. © 2020 The Author(s).",Ada lovelace,Analytical engine,Computer code,Digital,Digital humanities,Jacquard loom,Poetics,Poetry,Tan C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following a general Introduction, Section 2 provides an overview of the historical principles by which pitch accent and melody are coordinated in the ancient musical documents, and considers how these principles would apply in the context of tragedy's antistrophic song. Section 3 presents the results of a computational study of pitch accent responsion across all the extant lyrics of Aeschylus, finding the overall degree of responsion to be statistically significant compared to prose and verse control groups. In Section 4, I demonstrate how the melodic traces preserved in pitch accent patterns can be meaningfully related to the lyrics they accompany, using an example from the Kommos of Libation Bearers (434-43). © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2020",Aeschylus,Choral song,Delphic Hymns,Digital humanities,Greek lyric,Greek tragedy,Pitch accent,Strophic song,Conser A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article contributes to this discussion by presenting a method for detecting text reuse in a large corpus of digitized texts. Empirically, the article is based on the corpus of newspapers and journals from the collection of the National Library of Finland. Often, digitized repositories offer only partial views of what actually was published in printed form. The Finnish collection is unique, however, since it covers all published issues up to the year 1920. This article has a two-fold objective: methodologically, it explores how computational methods can be developed so that text reuse can be effectively identified; empirically, the article concentrates on how the circulation of texts developed in Finland from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century and what this reveals about the transformation of public discourse in Finland. According to our results, the reuse of texts was an integral part of the press throughout the studied period, which, on the other hand, was part of a wider transnational practice. © 2020 The Author(s).

Over the past two centuries, and since the establishment of the school of translation in Cairo in 1835, translation has been viewed as a vehicle of Nahda (progress) and Tanweer (enlightenment). Over the past two decades, however, translation in the Arab world has been radically transformed both at the practice and policy levels. The turn of the new millennium has brought about changes that have shaken the state of affairs and challenged old thinking and the ways of doing things. First, digital technology has changed the way things are done from work, play and study to the ways we socialise, shop and entertain ourselves. Second, a report on human development in the Arab world published in 2002 by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), revealed the unhealthy state of translation in most Arab countries. The paper examines the state of audiovisual study in Arabic and invites scholars to focus a lot more on their own local environment. It argues that a quarter of a century after the conference that launched the concept of AVT in Europe in 1995, the time has come for Arab academia to start developing its (own) theoretical frameworks for the localisation of audiovisual translation studies with the view of making translation studies not only relevant to society but also to play the role it was envisaged two centuries earlier. © ESSACHESS.",AHDR 2002,Arabic,Audiovisual culture,Covid-19,Digital humanities,Edutainment,Multimedia translation,,Gamal M.Y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sociology of emotions and digital humanities serve as theoretical support to explore the reinvention of the rhetorical keys of Fuguet’s poetics according to the configuration of new subjectivities in the 21st century. To this extent, the latest affect theories are applied within the digital culture and of “liquid love” (Bauman) in order to demonstrate that the rhythms of the present are manifested both in the construction of narrative discourse itself and in the new affective speeds that define the relationships between the characters. Thus, it is concluded that the use of technology, as a thematic and formal resource, operates in Sudor as a critical tool to question the changes that the digital paradigm has generated in the subjectivities development. © Marta Pascua Canelo, 2020.",Affective capitalism,Alberto Fuguet,Chilean literature,Grindr,Homosexuality and literature,Literature and technology,,,Canelo M.P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Archaeological research has been likewise limited, with the result that southern Phokis has remained largely untouched and unintegrated into the larger narratives of each of the major periods of antiquity. Recent work by the Southern Phokis Regional Project (SPRP) in the Desfina Plain is correcting this lacuna. SPRP is blending the strongest attributes of several disciplinary approaches (e.g. classics, archaeochemistry, digital humanities) to produce a comprehensive transdisciplinary study of the natural and cultural landscape of the region, thereby illuminating the important role of southern Phokis during some of the richest epochs of human history. Our 2018 study of Desfina’s natural and cultural environs, bolstered by excavations at the Mycenaean citadel of Kastrouli (ca. 1350-1000 B.C.E.), is revealing that southern Phokis served as a major, if not the primary, gateway to points south and west for northern Phokis, western Boiotia, and perhaps even eastern Lokris by securing access to the Corinthian Gulf. Our survey has documented ambitious engineering works that include a major hydrological project reminiscent of the Kopais Basin and “Cyclopean” terrace walls that sculpt the landscape. These achievements testify to a level of socio-cultural complexity and interconnectivity previously overlooked. In the shadows of Mount Parnassos, Desfina makes the best case yet to be not only the home of Echedameia, destroyed by Philipp II during the Third Sacred War, but also Homeric Anemoreia. © 2020.",Anemoreia and kyparissos,Digital humanities,Drone photogrammetry,Greek archaeology and history,Late bronze age collapse,Late helladic IIIc,OpenARCHEM,Transdisciplinarity,Koh A.J.,Birney K.J.,Roy I.M.,Liritzis I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inevitable question arose: How does one become ‘future-ready’? The answer lies, in part, in proactively engaging with evolving technologies and improving individual staff digital dexterities. Coinciding with release of The Future-Ready Library strategy, the Digital Literacy Workplace Program was put in place to foster upskilling opportunities for Library staff. One of the outcomes of this program was the creation of a local Digital Humanities Community of Practice in 2018. This article focuses on the transformative journey of the Community of Practice in developing staff digital dexterity through the completion of mini projects. These mini projects incorporated both hard and soft skillsets to develop agile, future-focused, T-shaped professionals. While initially directed at developing digital dexterity and increased knowledge of the Digital Humanities, the Community of Practice recognized the need for adoption of a broader, more strategic approach, to support clients and staff in this area. This resulted in the launch of the Digital Scholarship Strategy project in 2020. The project group was tasked with scoping the feasibility of initiating a Library-led roll-out across the organization, or a tighter focused implementation within the UOW Library operational environment.

Augmented reality via mobile devices offers a modern substitute for traditional forms of communicating scientific advocacy, enabling existing knowledge to be introduced in situ and in the course of everyday life. Building on those mobile communications with collaborative features that allow people’s insights and stories to be stored and shared offers a new way to gather public opinion and insights with minimal intrusion but immediate utility in ongoing planning and decision making at both the public and expert level. We describe a publicly available mobile phone application, youARhere, being launched in McIntosh County, Georgia on the marshland coast of the south eastern United States that both communicates projected plausible environmental futures and collaborates by prompting narratives imagining history as told from the future. The stories are shared through the application and used by researchers to form a collective narrative using modern qualitative techniques that search for commonly voiced sentiments and map them onto the places of their origin. This type of information product is emerging and valuable in modern decisionmaking environments where inclusivity is a concern and the current gap between science and the public threatens inaction on our inevitable climate future. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH.",Augmented reality,Climate change,Crowdsourcing,Digital humanities,Narratives,Storytelling,,,Taylor M.,Orland B.,Li J.,Berry S.,Welch-Devine M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, we describe the singularities of the constitution of this area of study in Brazil, along with the different aspects of the field of Mathematical Education. We then focus on the creation of a network of researchers that brings together specialists from more than twenty universities in Brazil, present in different parts of the country. Currently, GHEMAT Brasil is an association of researchers with a legal identity, developing collective research projects involving practically the whole of Brazil. The Group's research motto could be summarized as: learning from historians to produce history, paying attention to the knowledge accumulated by the History of Education, using mathematical formation and mathematics teaching practices as references. In the description of GHEMAT Brasil's activities, we present a brief history of the Group, its thematic choices and its theoretical and methodological affiliations. In the problematization of the work carried out by the Group at present, we identify the challenges facing collective research in the history of mathematics education, for which, we use a multitude of digital documents contained in the repository, the Group's database. In conclusion, we argue that GHEMAT Brazil studies should be included in the so-called Digital Humanities. © 2020 Historia y Memoria de la Educacion.All rights reserved.",Digital Humanities,GHEMAT,History of mathematics education,Repository,,,,,Valente W.R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study identifies the problem that studies in digital humanities have focused on the Anglo-American world. We demonstrate with an example in the Hong Kong context that even a curriculum of English language studies requires adaptation for the local needs, such as focus on second language learning and knowledge of contrastive grammar with the local language. To achieve these goals, instructors integrate materials that are tailored for students of language studies, who are typically proficient in humanistic argumentation and concepts but less fluent in digital skills. Use cases in teaching and examples of student projects are shown to illustrate the outcome of learning.

At the moment, the rise of Digital Humanities research has started to shift the focus to providing the user with integrated tools for solving research problems in interactive ways ('second generation systems'). This paper envisions and argues that the next step ahead to 'third generation systems' is based on Artificial Intelligence: future portals not only provide tools for the human to solve problems but are used for finding research problems in the first place, for addressing them, and even for solving them automatically under the constraints set by the human researcher. Such systems should preferably be able to explain their reasoning, which is an important aspect in the source critical humanities research tradition.

These are indispensable information resources for research into university history, but they are also useful for researching subjects such as the evolution of teaching, economics, university life and for biographical study. In the current culture of “openness,” a context which includes European legislation on digitization and on heritage and using new concept of Digital Humanities, the Archive can respond to the new challenges and engage in innovative lines of work which are adding value to the historical records. Current projects of the university Archive are discussed, projects which recognize the importance of understanding the user, digitization, open access, dissemination and cooperation.

Traditional map processing techniques typically rely on manually collected templates of the symbol of interest, and thus are not suitable for large-scale information extraction. In order to digitally preserve such large amounts of valuable retrospective geographic information, high levels of automation are required. Herein, we propose an automated machine-learning based framework to extract human settlement symbols, such as buildings and urban areas from historical topographic maps in the absence of training data, employing contemporary geospatial data as ancillary data to guide the collection of training samples. These samples are then used to train a convolutional neural network for semantic image segmentation, allowing for the extraction of human settlement patterns in an analysis-ready geospatial vector data format. We test our method on United States Geological Survey historical topographic maps published between 1893 and 1954. The results are promising, indicating high degrees of completeness in the extracted settlement features (i.e., recall of up to 0.96, F-measure of up to 0.79) and will guide the next steps to provide a fully automated operational approach for large-scale geographic feature extraction from a variety of historical map series. Moreover, the proposed framework provides a robust approach for the recognition of objects which are small in size, generalizable to many kinds of visual documents. © 2013 IEEE.",Convolutional neural networks,digital humanities,digital preservation,document analysis,geospatial analysis,geospatial artificial intelligence,human settlement patterns,image analysis,Uhl J.H.,Leyk S.,Chiang Y.-Y.,Duan W.,Knoblock C.A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This research effort has resulted in algorithms that can retrieve images from textual descriptions and vice versa, when realistic images and sentences with simple semantics are employed and when paired training data is provided. In this paper, we go beyond these limitations and tackle the design of visual-semantic algorithms in the domain of the Digital Humanities. This setting not only advertises more complex visual and semantic structures but also features a significant lack of training data which makes the use of fully-supervised approaches infeasible. With this aim, we propose a joint visual-semantic embedding that can automatically align illustrations and textual elements without paired supervision.

The Digging into Data 3 challenge (DID3) (2014–2016), an international and interdisciplinary grant initiative embracing big data, included 14 teams sponsored by 10 funders from four nations. A qualitative case study that relies on purposive sampling and grounded analysis, this article centers on the information practices of DID3 participants. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects.

In consequence, art historians occupy a new position in relation to the object of study. Museums have been equally transformed. The possibilities of creating virtual realities for lost/inaccessible monuments poses a new relationship between viewer and object in gallery spaces. Digital Humanities interventions in museums even allow us to preserve the memory of endangered global heritage sites that cease to exist or are inaccessible (celebrated examples including the lost Great Arch of Palmyra reconstructed with a 3D printer). Curatorial practices are now trending towards a sensorial and experiential approach. Is the role of Digital Humanities, in academic as well in museum settings, to “reveal” the object itself, through an empirical display of existing material, or to “reconstruct” something of the original experience of the object to engage spectators? Can we propose a reconciliation between these two “poles”?

By conducting a comparative analysis of Leonardo’s folios featuring fables, emblems, and engineering projects, I identify the archetypes of this interaction in the books contained in his personal library and examine the convergence of his use of empirical, diagrammatic, and pictorial strategies toward the investigation of nature. The material component of this study consists in a series of analytical drawing tables which examine recurrent patterns, and textual and visual connections in Leonardo’s manuscripts. The identified patterns are subsequently cataloged and examined through the web-publishing platform “LILeo” created in collaboration with the Rutgers Digital Humanities Laboratory as part of my dissertation project. By digitally highlighting the interaction of elements on the space of the page, and enabling the layering of drafts belonging to similar projects in Leonardo’s works and sources, this study traces the formal patterns of the artist’s analytical thinking in order to uncover the origins of his interdisciplinary research. © [2019] by the author; licensee Studies in Digital Heritage, IU, Bloomington (IN), USA.

The Digital Humanities has become a dynamic and fertile research field, and new projects and opportunities are constantly flourishing. The BYZART project perfectly fits this context. This project was coordinated by the Department of History and Cultures of the University of Bologna, embracing a wide consortium of partners from Bulgaria, Greece and Italy. It aimed at enhancing Byzantine and Post-Byzantine artistic and cultural heritage within the Europeana platform. This project enriched the existing Europeana collections with about 75,000 new cultural and artistic multimedia objects relevant to Byzantine history and culture, including collections of digitized photos, video and audio content. We also established a liaison between the new materials and Byzantine-related content already existing on Europeana. The archival material collected and digitized by the BYZART consortium is of the greatest cultural and art-historical importance, but it had not been properly evaluated or published before. For this reason, BYZART aimed to guarantee the preservation and evaluation of significant cultural heritage objects from a wide range of contexts, while also making them accessible to scholarly and general audiences alike. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Studies in Digital Heritage, IU, Bloomington (IN), USA.

In addition to analyzing the contents themselves, taking into account comments related to audiovisual publications makes it possible to understand their reception. It also allows us to grasp the social dynamics that are being set up on online exchange platforms. Focusing on data collected on Facebook, this article shows how this methodology makes it possible to approach a topic as sensitive as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is specifically aimed at presenting how the reference to Nazism serves as a means of delegitimizing the adversary, whether pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli. The author observes that the comment sections on Facebook are above all spaces of self-assertion and exchange between people who share the same opinions. Little room is left for intergroup exchanges that could lead to the development of a true dialogue. Hate speech is frequently found and is sometimes based on references to Nazism. In the end, in-depth analysis of the comments makes it possible to delimit four types of discursive strategies of (de)legitimation. © 2019 Simon Mastrangelo.",Digital anthropology,Digital humanities,Facebook,Israel-Palestine conflict,Social media,,,,Mastrangelo S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to this trend, our team developed the Chinese academic map publishing platform (AMAP) with the aim of supporting the digital humanities from a Chinese perspective. In compiling materials mined from China’s historical records, AMAP attempts to reconstruct the geographical distribution of entities including people, activities, and events, using places to connect these historical objects through time. This project marks the beginning of the development of a comprehensive database and visualization system to support humanities scholarship in China, and aims to facilitate the accumulation of spatiotemporal datasets, support multi-faceted queries, and provide integrated visualization tools. The software itself is built on Harvard’s WorldMap codebase, with enhancements which include improved support for Asian projections, support for Chinese encodings, the ability to handle long text attributes, feature level search, and mobile application support.

Scholars working on the early modern period (1400–1800) lack temporally appropriate geoparsers and gazetteers and have been reliant on general purpose linked open data services like Geonames. These anachronistic resources introduce significant information retrieval and ethical challenges for early modernists. Using the geography entries of the canonical eighteenth-century Encyclopédie, we evaluate rule-based named entity recognition (NER) systems to pinpoint areas where they would benefit from adjustments for processing historical corpora.

We present several ways to explore Parisian space and fictional landscapes by interactively and simultaneously browsing geographical space and literary text. Our project involves building a platform capable of retrieving, mapping and analyzing the occurrences of named urban roads in novels in which the action occurs wholly or partly in Paris. This platform will be used in several areas, such as cultural tourism, urban research, and literary analysis. The paper focuses on extracting named urban roads and mapping the results for a sample of 31 novels published between 1800 and 1914. Two approaches to the annotation of odonyms are compared. First, we describe a proof of concept using queries made via the TXM textual analysis platform. Then, we describe an automatic process using a natural language processing (NLP) method. Additionally, we mention how the geosemantic information annotated from the text (e.g., a structure combining verbs, spatial relations, named entities, adjectives and adverbs) can be used to automatically characterize the semantic content associated with named urban roads. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital humanities,Geographical information retrieval,geoparsing,mapping,named entity recognition,novels,odonyms,Paris,Moncla L.,Gaio M.,Joliveau T.,Le Lay Y.-F.,Boeglin N.,Mazagol P.-O.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the social sciences and humanities in South Korea have shown a marked reluctance toward the integration of digital technology, the perception of its necessity as a new methodology for developing these fields in the digital age is growing. Until recently, analytical studies on the status and contents of DH were conducted on data from the western world. Despite their late start, however, Asian countries have begun conducting research on DH with enthusiasm. In order for DH to be properly established in each country, it is essential to set the direction by investigating the pre-requisites for DH studies in that country, as well as the current and future demands. As such, this study discusses the current status and issues regarding DH in South Korea by analyzing the trends of DH research published in South Korea, as well as by examining the status and perception of DH among actual scholars.

The Ryan Report (2009), the official report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (CICA), details the systematic abuse of thousands of children from 1936 to 1999 in residential institutions run by religious orders and funded and overseen by the Irish State. Arguably, the sheer size of the Ryan Report-over 1 million words-warrants a new approach that blends close readings to witness its findings, with distant readings that help surface system-wide findings embedded in the Report. Although CICA has been lauded internationally for its work, many have critiqued the narrative form of the Ryan Report, for obfuscating key findings and providing poor systemic, statistical summaries that are crucial to evaluating the political and cultural context in which the abuse took place (Keenan, 2013, Child Sexual Abuse and the Catholic Church: Gender, Power, and Organizational Culture. Oxford University Press). In this article, we concentrate on describing the distant reading methodology we adopted, using machine learning and text-analytic methods and report on what they surfaced from the Report. The contribution of this work is threefold: (i) it shows how text analytics can be used to surface new patterns, summaries and results that were not apparent via close reading, (ii) it demonstrates how machine learning can be used to annotate text by using word embedding to compile domain-specific semantic lexicons for feature extraction and (iii) it demonstrates how digital humanities methods can be applied to an official state inquiry with social justice impact. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

This event (and the narrative that follows) is found throughout the literature, leading some to believe that early DH work 'concentrated, perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text analysis (such as classification systems, mark-up, text encoding, and scholarly editing)' (Presner, 2010, p. 6). Others seem convinced that DH is still only text analysis or too dominated by it (Meeks, 2013)-and misguided in its approach (Fish, 2012). Meanwhile, Underwood (2017) has recently made a case for disentangling distant reading methods from DH generally, noting that the former predates and does not depend on digital technology. This article presents an empirical perspective on the early history of DH by tracing publications in two foundational journals (Computers and the Humanities (CHum), established in 1966, and Literary and Linguistic Computing (LLC), established in 1986), with particular emphasis on media types, authors' disciplines and locations, and teaching and learning. In doing so, we examine the extent to which early DH work focused on text analysis as well as broader trends in the early history of the field. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Shelf life: Identifying the abandonment of online digital humanities projects,1,10.1093/llc/fqy079,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082502203&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqy079&partnerID=40&md5=ad719be89fc2d289b291f58fe779be9c,"A large portion of the research carried out in the digital humanities has an online digital object (usually referred as a project) as one of its components. In turn, these online digital objects can be catalogued as distributed resources, which implies that the administrative control of information related to a topic may be spread across online resources and/or collections maintained by multiple scholars in different institutions. This administrative decentralization can lead to changes in content that are often unexpected by a researcher, which can be caused by different factors or circumstances. This reasoning led us to formulate the following question: When can online digital humanities projects be considered abandoned? In this article, we carry out a study on the persistence and average life span of online projects in the digital humanities. More specifically, we will elaborate on their reliance on distributed resources and methods for measuring their shelf life: the average length of time that a digital project can endure without updates until it can ultimately be considered abandoned by its researcher. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Optical character recognition of typeset Coptic text with neural networks,1,10.1093/llc/fqz023,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082467494&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqz023&partnerID=40&md5=0102dd3b224de866977d7c71ab678dde,"Digital Humanities (DH) within Coptic Studies, an emerging field of development, will be much aided by the digitization of large quantities of typeset Coptic texts. Until recently, the only Optical Character Recognition (OCR) analysis of printed Coptic texts had been executed by Moheb S. Mekhaiel, who used the Tesseract program to create a text model for liturgical books in the Bohairic dialect of Coptic. However, this model is not suitable for the many scholarly editions of texts in the Sahidic dialect of Coptic which use noticeably different fonts. In the current study, DH and Coptological projects based in Göttingen, Germany, collaborated to develop a new Coptic OCR pipeline suitable for use with all Coptic dialects. The objective of the study was to generate a model which can facilitate digital Coptic Studies and produce Coptic corpora from existing printed texts. First, we compared the two available OCR programs that can recognize Coptic: Tesseract and Ocropy. The results indicated that the neural network model, i.e. Ocropy, performed better at recognizing the letters with supralinear strokes that characterize the published Sahidic texts. After training Ocropy for Coptic using artificial neural networks, the team achieved an accuracy rate of >91% for the OCR analysis of Coptic typeset. We subsequently compared the efficiency of Ocropy to that of manual transcribing and concluded that the use of Ocropy to extract Coptic from digital images of printed texts is highly beneficial to Coptic DH. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

In our work as part of ""Endings"", an umbrella project that comprises four diverse digital edition projects from different fields, we have developed a methodology for checking and enforcing correctness, completeness, and coherence across the entire document set. The following article describes the various stages (what we term ""levels"") of our diagnostics process, all of which are driven by XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) stylesheets, and produce a human readable report. These levels include checks for referential integrity, correct entity tagging, and potential duplicates in the data set. Using examples from the Endings projects, we show how diagnostic processes not only ensure correctness in the data set, but can also aid in determining project milestones and completion dates. Diagnostics, we argue, are thus a crucial extension to schema-based validation for complex digital projects and can provide concrete ways for digital humanities projects to enforce coherence and consistency and track their progress toward completion. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

In this work we use Natural Language Processing techniques to retrieve large amounts of historical information from Wikipedia. In particular, the pages of a set of historically notable individuals are processed to catch the locations and the date of people’s movements. This information is then structured in a geographical network of mobility patterns. We analyze the mobility of historically notable individuals from different perspectives to better understand the role of migrations and international collaborations in the context of innovation and cultural development. In this work, we first present some general characteristics of the dataset from a social and geographical perspective. Then, we build a spatial network of cities, and we model and quantify the tendency to explore of a set of people that can be considered as historically and culturally notable. In this framework, we show that by using a multilevel radiation model for human mobility, we are able to catch important features of migration’s behavior. Results show that the choice of the target migration place for historically and culturally relevant people is limited to a small number of locations and that it depends on the discipline a notable is interested in and on the number of opportunities she/he can find there. © 2019, The Author(s).",Computational social science,Human behavior understanding,Human mobility,Natural language processing,Network theory,,,,Lucchini L.,Tonelli S.,Lepri B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our framework, distant viewing, is distinguished from other approaches by making explicit the interpretive nature of extracting semantic metadata from images. In other words, one must 'view' visual materials before studying them. We illustrate the need for the interpretive process of viewing by simultaneously drawing on theories of visual semiotics, photography, and computer vision. Two illustrative applications of the distant viewing framework to our own research are draw upon to explicate the potential and breadth of the approach. A study of television series shows how facial detection is used to compare the role of actors within the narrative arcs across two competing series. An analysis of the Farm Security Administration-Office of War Information corpus of documentary photography is used to establish how photographic style compared and differed amongst those photographers involved with the collection.

As the emphasis has moved from long-standing scientific methods of quantification to the overall digital turn of everyday life, this process sheds light on the varying sociocultural conditions for calculations in modern societies. Consequently, numbers cannot be conceived as inherent properties of things by discovery through experimentation and explanation: this essentialist conception seems to originate in a misunderstanding of nineteenth-century scientific research and its claim of objectivity. Rather, quantification and the cultural matrices of calculation build a raster image serving as an interface between world and mind. In this broad sense, everyday life is deeply pervaded by numbers. Moreover, the ability for calculations cannot be treated as a uniform skill any more. Instead, it varies in accordance with different cultural forms and functions. Number-based practices are also represented widely in modern literature and in non-literary works, such as being in the letters and diaries of many writers. The essay is thus intended to analyze and compare the forms of calculation in the novels and diaries of some East Central European writers—such as Kafka, Kosztolányi, Musil—who thrived in the first decades of the twentieth century. In so doing, it describes three models through which calculation as a cultural practice enters the field of literature. © 2019, The Author(s).",Cultural practices,Iteration in literature,Numbers,Operational knowledge,,,,,Bengi L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It conjoins domains conventionally female-dominated (Humanities disciplines) with technology domains that have been regarded as male-dominated. Yet while there has been much research on women within technology-driven work environments in general, there has been no research on DH as an emerging employment context, or on the impacts of gender in its formation both as workplace and as a site for professional identities. This article draws on qualitative research conducted in 2017/18. It examines how gender, DH as a materialized workplace, and professional identities within it, are imbricated in a field characterized by ‘intersectionalized identities’.

Computational text analysis within the Humanities: How to combine working practices from the contributing fields?,8,10.1007/s10579-019-09459-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068203513&doi=10.1007%2fs10579-019-09459-3&partnerID=40&md5=4877f487738541e34829c81842ce78ae,"This position paper is based on a keynote presentation at the COLING 2016 Workshop on Language Technology for Digital Humanities in Osaka, Japan. It departs from observations about working practices in Humanities disciplines following a hermeneutic tradition of text interpretation versus the method-oriented research strategies in Computational Linguistics (CL). The respective praxeological traditions are quite different. Yet more and more researchers are willing to open up towards truly transdisciplinary collaborations, trying to exploit advanced methods from CL within research that ultimately addresses questions from the traditional Humanities disciplines and the Social Sciences. The article identifies two central workflow-related issues for this type of collaborative project in the Digital Humanities (DH) and Computational Social Science: (1) a scheduling dilemma, which affects the point in the course of the project when specifications of the core analysis task are fixed (as early as possible from the computational perspective, but as late as possible from the Humanities perspective) and (2) the subjectivity problem, which concerns the degree of intersubjective stability of the target categories of analysis. CL methodology demands high inter-annotator agreement and theory-independent categories, while the categories in hermeneutic reasoning are often tied to a particular interpretive approach (viz. a theory of literary interpretation) and may bear a non-trivial relation to a reader’s pre-understanding. Building a comprehensive methodological framework that helps overcome these issues requires considerable time and patience. The established computational methodology has to be gradually opened up to more hermeneutically oriented research questions; resources and tools for the relevant categories of analysis have to be constructed. This article does not call into question that well-targeted efforts along this path are worthwhile. Yet, it makes the following additional programmatic point regarding directions for future research: It might be fruitful to explore—in parallel—the potential lying in DH-specific variants of the concept of rapid prototyping from Software Engineering. To get an idea of how computational analysis of some aspect of text might contribute to a hermeneutic research question, a prototypical analysis model is constructed, e.g., from related data collections and analysis categories, using transfer techniques. While the initial quality of analysis may be limited, the idea of rapid probing allows scholars to explore how the analysis fits in an actual workflow on the target text data and it can thus provide early feedback for the process of refining the modeling. If the rapid probing method can indeed be incorporated in a hermeneutic framework to the satisfaction of well-disposed Humanities scholars, a swifter exploration of alternative paths of analysis would become possible. This may generate considerable additional momentum for transdisciplinary integration. It is as yet too early to point to truly Humanities-oriented examples of the proposed rapid probing technique. To nevertheless make the programmatic idea more concrete, the article uses two experimental scenarios to argue how rapid probing might help addressing the scheduling dilemma and the subjectivity problem respectively. The first scenario illustrates the transfer of complex analysis pipelines across corpora; the second one addresses rapid annotation experiments targeting character mentions in literary text. © 2019, The Author(s).",Adaptation of NLP tool chains,Digital humanities,Interdisciplinary working practice,,,,,,Kuhn J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Texts in the corpus are encoded following best practices in the digital humanities, including markup of metadata that enables time-sensitive research, linguistic and other, of the corpus. Evaluation of morphological analysis based on Modern Hebrew language models is shown to distinguish between genres in the historical variety, highlighting the importance of ephemeral materials for linguistic research and for potential collaboration with libraries and cultural institutions in the process of corpus creation.

In order to address this lack, we report the results of two within-group user-centred studies of two online bibliographic systems in a realistic setting — using a widely deployed OPAC and its counterpart linked-data based system, datos.bne.es. The results of our first within-group study show that users of the system based on linked data required significantly less time and visited fewer pages to complete a typical search and retrieval activity. Additionally, the results of our user satisfaction tests also provided significantly better results for this new system. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that semantic technologies applied to library catalogues provide an enhancement that helps satisfy users’ information needs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Cultural heritage,Digital humanities,Linked data,Ontologies,Usability,User-centred evaluation,,,Rico M.,Vila-Suero D.,Botezan I.,Gómez-Pérez A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Token-based spelling variant detection in Middle Low German texts,1,10.1007/s10579-018-09441-5,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061335680&doi=10.1007%2fs10579-018-09441-5&partnerID=40&md5=7694eead5ed3feb1700c8d21059d56ae,"In this paper we present a pipeline for the detection of spelling variants, i.e., different spellings that represent the same word, in non-standard texts. For example, in Middle Low German texts in and ihn (among others) are potential spellings of a single word, the personal pronoun ‘him’. Spelling variation is usually addressed by normalization, in which non-standard variants are mapped to a corresponding standard variant, e.g. the Modern German word ihn in the case of in. However, the approach to spelling variant detection presented here does not need such a reference to a standard variant and can therefore be applied to data for which a standard variant is missing.The pipeline we present first generates spelling variants for a given word using rewrite rules and surface similarity. Afterwards, the generated types are filtered. We present a new filter that works on the token level, i.e., taking the context of a word into account. Through this mechanism ambiguities on the type level can be resolved. For instance, the Middle Low German word in can not only be the personal pronoun ‘him’, but also the preposition ‘in’, and each of these has different variants. The detected spelling variants can be used in two settings for Digital Humanities research: On the one hand, they can be used to facilitate searching in non-standard texts. On the other hand, they can be used to improve the performance of natural language processing tools on the data by reducing the number of unknown words.To evaluate the utility of the pipeline in both applications, we present two evaluation settings and evaluate the pipeline on Middle Low German texts. We were able to improve the F1 score compared with previous work from 0.39 to 0.52 for the search setting and from 0.23 to 0.30 when detecting spelling variants of unknown words. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Historical texts,Information retrieval,Non-standard language,Spelling variation,,,,,Barteld F.,Biemann C.,Zinsmeister H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Already, this has led to the creation of many such knowledge graphs, many of which are now available as part of the Linked Open Data cloud. This presents new opportunities for data mining. In this work, we develop, implement, and evaluate (both data-driven and user-driven) an end-to-end pipeline for user-centric pattern mining on knowledge graphs in the humanities. This pipeline combines constrained generalized association rule mining with natural language output and facet rule browsing to allow for transparency and interpretability—two key domain requirements.

As a scholar-vidder, I focus on vidding as one form this work might take. Vidding is an especially affective form of remix art that renders literal the Foucauldian imperative “knowledge is not made for understanding; it is made for cutting.” In disturbing what was previously considered immobile, fragmenting what was thought unified, and not hiding the cuts with which it does so, vidding produces affective surplus. It is not only that a vid disassembles source media, but that its reassembly produces more than a new text; it also, often unpredictably and inexplicably, generates entirely new affects. Taken up as a transfeminist creative critical praxis, vidding could challenge the transphobic and cissexist common sense on which our reality relies, including its teleological histories that cast trans as “new,” ignoring the contributions of trans people to feminist and queer movements and the historical and geographical range of gender variance; liberal discourses that approach trans as yet another matter of civil rights, neglecting how visibility renders trans people more susceptible to violence and surveillance; and media narratives which tell the same fetishizing, isolating, and tragic stories of trans lives time and again. Through my analysis of three of my own transfeminist vids, I introduce the digital humanities methodology “remixing transfeminist futures” and propose we remix our transphobic, transmisogynistic, cissexist reality so as to make perceptible a future when trans people, queer people, people of color, and all women and femmes are free. © 2019 Duke University Press","Fandom,","Remix,",Scholarly vidding,"Trans temporality,","Transfeminism,",,,,Samer R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one publication, Friending the Past: The Sense of History in the Digital Age, Alan Liu notes: 'The signal sense of history [. . .] is not just like a plot on a radar scope. It is like the unfolding epic plot of Tolstoy's War and Peace' (p. 157). As political scandals over the use of social media and the role of cyber-targeting to influence electoral outcomes continue to dominate the news, it is becoming increasingly evident that not only are social media ushering in an era in which we are alienated from our personal data, but that today's digitalized world builds on and replicates pre-digital hegemonic structures. Books by Andrew Piper and Alan Liu discuss ways in which scholars can approach the complexities and challenges of literary tradition and historical transmutation through the application of computational methods and digital tools. Discussion then turns to the ways in which digital practices have converged with wider cultural and political developments since the second half of the twentieth century. Lee Humphreys examines this transformation through the traces that we leave as the record of our daily lives while on social media, while Felix Stalder considers how such practices have wider ramifications as symptoms of a 'digital condition', for good and ill. Exploring the pressure points of the digital condition more closely, Safiya Umoja Noble scrutinizes the ways in which algorithmic processes, notably those that drive Google's search engine, are shaped by and sustain discriminatory regimes at the expense of vulnerable minorities. Finally, Roopika Risam's critique interrogates the field of the digital humanities itself, which-notwithstanding good intentions- remains dominated by the Global North and is at risk of perpetuating the very power structures that it seeks to dismantle. © The English Association (2019) All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,Mandal A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Invariant image-based currency denomination recognition using local entropy and range filters,3,10.3390/e21111085,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075445990&doi=10.3390%2fe21111085&partnerID=40&md5=2bc957123802e4fbb305774ca065e28c,"We perform image-based denomination recognition of the Pakistani currency notes. There are a total of seven different denominations in the current series of Pakistani notes. Apart from color and texture, these notes differ from one another mainly due to their aspect ratios. Our aim is to exploit this single feature to attain an image-based recognition that is invariant to the most common image variations found in currency notes images. Among others, the most notable image variations are caused by the difference in positions and in-plane orientations of the currency notes in images. While most of the proposed methods for currency denomination recognition only focus on attaining higher recognition rates, our aim is more complex, i.e., attaining a high recognition rate in the presence of image variations. Since, the aspect ratio of a currency note is invariant to such differences, an image-based recognition of currency notes based on aspect ratio is more likely to be translation- and rotation-invariant. Therefore, we adapt a two step procedure that first extracts a currency note from the homogeneous image background via local entropy and range filters. Then, the aspect ratio of the extracted currency note is calculated to determine its denomination. To validate our proposed method, we gathered a new dataset with the largest and most diverse collection of Pakistani currency notes, where each image contains either a single or multiple notes at arbitrary positions and orientations. We attain an overall average recognition rate of 99% which is very encouraging for our method, which relies on a single feature and is suited for real-time applications. Consequently, the method may be extended to other international and historical currencies, which makes it suitable for business and digital humanities applications. © 2019 by the authors.",Image entropy,Image processing,Image segmentation,,,,,,Anwar H.,Ullah F.,Iqbal A.,Ul Hasnain A.,Ur Rehman A.,Bell P.,Kwak D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response, controversy mapping, reverse engineering and hacking have been key methodological devices to grapple with opacity and ‘open the black box’ of digital ecosystems. We take recent developments in digital humanitarianism and the accelerated production of apps for refugees following the 2015 Mediterranean refugee crisis as a site of methodological experimentation to advance hacking as critical methodological interference. Drawing on the work of Michel Serres, we propose to understand digital technologies as ‘parasitic’ and reconceptualise hacking as ‘acts of digital parasitism’. Acts of digital parasitism are interferences that work alongside rather than work against. On one hand, this reworking of hacking advances an agenda for digital methods through reworking hacking for digital humanities and social science research. On the other, it allows us to show how the object of research – humanitarian apps – is configured through platformisation and incorporation within digital parasitic relations. © The Author(s) 2019.",Apps,humanitarianism,methods,parasite,platforms,Serres,,,Aradau C.,Blanke T.,Greenway G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These systems typically rest on the concepts of objects and fields, both bound to coordinates, as two general paradigms of geographic representation. The match between notions of place occurring in everyday where questions and the data available to answer such questions is unclear and hinders progress in place-based information systems. This is particularly true in novel application areas such as the Digital Humanities or speech-based human–computer interaction, but also for location-based services. Although this shortcoming has been observed before, we approach the challenges of relating places to information system representations with a fresh view, based on a set of core concepts of spatial information. These concepts have been proposed in information science with the intent of serving human–machine spatial question asking and answering. Clarifying the relationship of the notion of place to these concepts is a significant step toward geographically intelligent systems. The main result of the article is a demonstration that the notion of place fits existing concepts of spatial information, when these are adequately exploited and combined. © 2019 The Authors.

I draw on postcolonial digital humanities and additional framings to demonstrate Empire's intentional unavailability of technological resources, like census cards, that may have mediated against communal bloodshed while also serving as a testament to early technology that nurtured DH. After detailing the violent production of racialised colonialism's impossibility of an Indian modernity, I turn to Bollywood cinema as a technological realm through which we can trace an alternative genealogy anchored by digital necropolitics, or the right to expose people to harm in cyberspace.

Its impressions can be seen across curricula, syllabi, classroom structures, IT systems; and other dimensions of the epistemic infrastructure of CS (Malazita [Forthcoming]. “Epistemic Infrastructures, the Instrumental Turn, and the Digital Humanities.” In Debates in the Digital Humanities: Infrastructures, Institutions at the Interstices, edited by Angel Nieves, Siobhan Senier, and Anne McGrail. University of Minnesota Press). As we will argue in this essay, abstraction in CS serves as an epistemic, cultural, and ideological wall to integrated critical-technical education, rather than as a bridge. Further, this wall is disguised as a bridge: the common language used across CS and the Humanities gives the impression that abstraction can be leveraged as a boundary object (Star [2010]. “This is Not a Boundary Object: Reflections on the Origin of a Concept.” Science, Technology, & Human Values 35 (5): 601–617), as a point of connection among conflicting or incommensurable epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina [1999]. Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge. Cambridge: MIT Press). Rather, computational knowledge practices leverage abstraction’s homographic-ness, epistemically structuring collaborative efforts in anti-political ways. To illustrate the impacts of abstraction, this essay will introduce ‘Critical CS1,’ a hybrid pedagogical approach to teaching Computer Science through feminist and critical race theory. However, other components of the epistemic infrastructures of Computer Science, from curricular structure, to IT systems, to classroom culture, to the epistemic practices of coding itself, resisted these intervention efforts, and reproduced marginalizing effects upon students within the course. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",abstraction,Computer science education,critical pedagogy,epistemic infrastructures,feminist STS,,,,Malazita J.W.,Resetar K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study of these character networks exhibits the deviation as per the demands of the visual medium. We propose an efficient method using different weighted graph centrality metrics such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and edge contribution factor to explore the dissimilarity in the character categorization within a story and its adapted film.

As one of the results the paper demonstrates that a somewhat surprising historical hero surfaced when the 1590s were adapted in the context of a new nationalism. Methodologically the article combines computational distant reading and more traditional close reading to disclose the core characters of each play individually, and, taken together, of the early fictional ‘story space’ of the event. The article argues that even such small-scale investigations can benefit from the systematic analytical tools offered by digital humanities that can reveal wholly new facets of the texts that more traditional literary history may overlook. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Improving author verification based on topic modeling,11,10.1002/asi.24183,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062783221&doi=10.1002%2fasi.24183&partnerID=40&md5=017d7bec843d399146041700eaa3bedd,"Authorship analysis attempts to reveal information about authors of digital documents enabling applications in digital humanities, text forensics, and cyber-security. Author verification is a fundamental task where, given a set of texts written by a certain author, we should decide whether another text is also by that author. In this article we systematically study the usefulness of topic modeling in author verification. We examine several author verification methods that cover the main paradigms, namely, intrinsic (attempt to solve a one-class classification task) and extrinsic (attempt to solve a binary classification task) methods as well as profile-based (all documents of known authorship are treated cumulatively) and instance-based (each document of known authorship is treated separately) approaches combined with well-known topic modeling methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use benchmark data sets and demonstrate that LDA is better combined with extrinsic methods, while the most effective intrinsic method is based on LSI. Moreover, topic modeling seems to be particularly effective for profile-based approaches and the performance is enhanced when latent topics are extracted by an enriched set of documents. The comparison to state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the great potential of the approaches presented in this study. It is also demonstrates that even when genre-agnostic external documents are used, the proposed extrinsic models are very competitive. © 2019 ASIS&T",,,,,,,,,Potha N.,Stamatatos E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper describes an approach to information visualization that encourages students to foreground humanistic concerns by adopting a narrative focus. This approach to visualization development brings interdisciplinary perspectives and techniques to bear on qualitative or quantitative information and constructs stories from those data. To illustrate student experiences, I describe four student projects completed in a graduate course on narrative information visualization. I focus on how this course enabled students to take diverse types of data and construct engaging interactive stories using a range of tools and methods, while continually reflecting critically on their evolving goals and design choices. I conclude by showing how this approach helps students connect humanistic values to information visualization techniques. © The Author(s) 2018.",critical humanities,data visualization,Digital humanities,interdisciplinary,narrative,,,,Stephens S.H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The different critical conventions are well known and have been subject to a myriad of scientific studies. Nevertheless, critical edition has been undergoing changes since the development of new technologies. Digital critical editions have multiplied and today represent a large and varied panel. As a consequence, it's worth observing, beyond technological innovations, what digital editing brings in terms of methodology and publishing conceptualisation. Obviously, in digital editions as in traditional editions, the final goal is offering readers a text that they will be able to consult and use in their research: The edited text should be a stable one, that can be an authoritative resource. The uniqueness of digital edition's design, however, requires editors to reflect, right from the start of the publication process, on the information that they are going to provide, as well as on the way in which they will be presenting it. From the very beginning of its development, digital editing entails, then, a true awareness of how it will be received. It permits, also, a significant diversification of information presented in editions. It ultimately distinguishes itself with its open nature: Digital editing is open in terms of content evolution over time just as it is in terms of collaborative editing. © 2019 The Author(s).",Critical editing,Digital editing,Digital humanities,Digital philology,Philology,,,,Casenave J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a content analysis methodology, which further draws techniques from data mining, natural language processing and information visualization to analyze three peer-reviewed journals published within the last five years and ten online university library research guides in this field. Findings: To successfully support and effectively contribute to the digital humanities, academic librarians should be knowledgeable in more than just visualization concepts and tools. The content analysis results for the digital humanities journals reflect the importance of recognizing the wide variety of applications and purposes of information visualization in digital humanities research. Practical implications: This study provides useful and actionable insights into how academic librarians can prepare for this emerging technology to support future endeavors in the digital humanities. Originality/value: Although information visualization has been widely adopted in digital humanities research, it remains unclear how librarians, especially academic librarians who support digital humanities research, should prepare for this emerging technology.

Development and evaluation of an automatic text annotation system for supporting digital humanities research,6,10.1108/LHT-10-2017-0219,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057182745&doi=10.1108%2fLHT-10-2017-0219&partnerID=40&md5=9fa2268d9f9e384d1ff502143f6420ea,"Purpose: An automatic text annotation system (ATAS) that can collect resources from different databases through Linked Data (LD) for automatically annotating ancient texts was developed in this study to support digital humanities research. It allows the humanists referring to resources from diverse databases when interpreting ancient texts as well as provides a friendly text annotation reader for humanists interpreting ancient text through reading. The paper aims to discuss whether the ATAS is helpful to support digital humanities research or not. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the quasi-experimental design, the ATAS developed in this study and MARKUS semi-ATAS were compared whether the significant differences in the reading effectiveness and technology acceptance for supporting humanists interpreting ancient text of the Ming dynasty’s collections existed or not. Additionally, lag sequential analysis was also used to analyze users’ operation behaviors on the ATAS. A semi-structured in-depth interview was also applied to understand users’ opinions and perception of using the ATAS to interpret ancient texts through reading. Findings: The experimental results reveal that the ATAS has higher reading effectiveness than MARKUS semi-ATAS, but not reaching the statistically significant difference. The technology acceptance of the ATAS is significantly higher than that of MARKUS semi-ATAS. Particularly, the function comparison of the two systems shows that the ATAS presents more perceived ease of use on the functions of term search, connection to source websites and adding annotation than MARKUS semi-ATAS. Furthermore, the reading interface of ATAS is simple and understandable and is more suitable for reading than MARKUS semi-ATAS. Among all the considered LD sources, Moedict, which is an online Chinese dictionary, was confirmed as the most helpful one. Research limitations/implications: This study adopted Jieba Chinese parser to perform the word segmentation process based on a parser lexicon for the Chinese ancient texts of the Ming dynasty’s collections. The accuracy of word segmentation to a lexicon-based Chinese parser is limited due to ignoring the grammar and semantics of ancient texts. Moreover, the original parser lexicon used in Jieba Chinese parser only contains the modern words. This will reduce the accuracy of word segmentation for Chinese ancient texts. The two limitations that affect Jieba Chinese parser to correctly perform the word segmentation process for Chinese ancient texts will significantly affect the effectiveness of using ATAS to support digital humanities research. This study thus proposed a practicable scheme by adding new terms into the parser lexicon based on humanists’ self-judgment to improve the accuracy of word segmentation of Jieba Chinese parser. Practical implications: Although some digital humanities platforms have been successfully developed to support digital humanities research for humanists, most of them have still not provided a friendly digital reading environment to support humanists on interpreting texts. For this reason, this study developed an ATAS that can automatically retrieve LD sources from different databases on the Internet to supply rich annotation information on reading texts to help humanists interpret texts. This study brings digital humanities research to a new ground. Originality/value: This study proposed a novel ATAS that can automatically annotate useful information on an ancient text to increase the readability of the ancient text based on LD sources from different databases, thus helping humanists obtain a deeper and broader understanding in the ancient text. Currently, there is no this kind of tool developed for humanists to support digital humanities research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Automatic segmentation of Chinese word,Automatic text annotation system,Digital humanities,Linked Data,Reading interface design,User behaviour,,,Chen C.-M.,Chen Y.-T.,Liu C.-Y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It explains HTR, demonstrates Transkribus, gives examples of use cases, highlights the affect HTR may have on scholarship, and evidences this turning point of the advanced use of digitised heritage content. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts a case study approach, using the development and delivery of the one openly available HTR platform for manuscript material. Findings: Transkribus has demonstrated that HTR is now a useable technology that can be employed in conjunction with mass digitisation to generate accurate transcripts of archival material. Use cases are demonstrated, and a cooperative model is suggested as a way to ensure sustainability and scaling of the platform. However, funding and resourcing issues are identified. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents results from projects: further user studies could be undertaken involving interviews, surveys, etc. Practical implications: Only HTR provided via Transkribus is covered: however, this is the only publicly available platform for HTR on individual collections of historical documents at time of writing and it represents the current state-of-the-art in this field. Social implications: The increased access to information contained within historical texts has the potential to be transformational for both institutions and individuals.

Based on historical dialect atlas data, we calculate a linguistic distance matrix across survey localities. The linguistic variation expressed through this distance is contrasted with several measurements, based on spatial distance, utilised to estimate language contact potential across Japan, historically and at present. Further, administrative boundaries are tested for their separation effect. Measuring aggregate associations within linguistic variation can contrast previous notions of dialect area formation by detecting continua. Depending on local geographies in spatial subsets, great circle distance, travel distance and travel times explain a similar proportion of the variance in linguistic distance despite the limitations of the latter two. While they explain the majority, two further measurements estimating contact have lower explanatory power: least cost paths, modelling contact before the industrial revolution, based on DEM and sea navigation, and a linguistic influence index based on settlement hierarchy. Historical domain boundaries and present day prefecture boundaries are found to have a statistically significant effect on dialectal variation. However, the interplay of boundaries and distance is yet to be identified. We claim that a similar methodology can address spatial variation in other digital humanities, given a similar spatial and attribute granularity. © 2019 by the authors.",Dialect geography,Digital humanities,Geostatistics,GIScience,Historical GIS,Language change,Language contact,Linguistic variation,Jeszenszky P.,Hikosaka Y.,Imamura S.,Yano K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their application usually remains fairly simple and superficial, and fails to exploit the resources which the digital era holds for discourse analysis to their full extent. This paper discusses the discourse-analytic potential of a more complex and advanced text analysis tool, which is already frequently employed in other approaches to textual analysis, notably topic modelling. We argue that topic modelling promises advances in areas where discourse analysis has traditionally struggled, such as scaling, repetition, and systematization, which go beyond the contributions of simpler frequency and collocation counts. At the same time, it does not violate the epistemological premises and methodological ethos of even the more radical theories of discourse, we will demonstrate. Finally, we present two small case studies to show how topic modelling–when used with appropriate parameters–can straightforwardly enhance our ability to systematically investigate and interpret discourses in large collections of text.

This paper seeks to recover one type of technical labor, digitization, as information work that embodies mental and manual activities and is both materially and intellectually productive. This paper draws on findings from an empirical study conducted by the author from 2015–2017 that used qualitative-interpretive methods to study the discursive and material practices of professional media preservationists as they worked to digitize analog video recordings in small-scale, high-quality (“artisanal”) digitization projects. One key finding of this research is that in order to produce “legitimate” digital copies within their institutional contexts, media preservationists must coordinate their physical and mental activities to develop understanding of the invisible electrical signals that carry the encoded video information, blending objective and subjective modalities of knowledge. These findings have implications for understanding how the invisible labor of digitization has significant mental as well as manual dimensions, contributing to ongoing debates in information studies and the digital humanities on the relationship between “doing” and “signifying” in terms of knowledge work. © 2019 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.",,,,,,,,,Lischer-Katz Z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, intense visuality in lectures is linked to a growing need for the ability to decipher the complex semiological landscapes that slides represent. This work is based on the analysis of a corpus of lecture slides drawn from the mIT OpenCourseWare initiative. Through a qualitative approach, it observes the fluidity of the different types of resources, with particular attention paid to visuals. This study offers an analytical framework which represents an embryonic rubric for operationalizing the grammar of visuals. It is based on a fluid and dynamic conception of visuals and focuses on the hybridity of the different semiotic resources, which often cannot be ascribed to specific categories without running into reductionist simplifications. The approach adopted aims to go beyond the investigation of the contribution made by individual modes, and to consider the meaning created dynamically by the interaction of the different resources, in a circular process which goes from the singular to the global and vice versa. Results show that the multiple semiotic resources involved develop syncretically and have a reciprocal transformative function in the meaning-making process. Also, they synergically convey the information desired through their mutual validation. © 2019, AELFE.

I invite as scholars of the digital humanities to see in the region’s belief in incompleteness and the compositeness of being human, as well as in the capacity to be present everywhere at the same time an indication that we have much to learn from the past on how best to understand and harness current purportedly innovative advances in ICTs. The idea of digital technologies making it possible for humans and things to be present even in their absence and absent even in their presence is not that dissimilar to the belief in what is often labelled and dismissed as witchcraft and magic that lends itself to a world of infinite possibilities – a world of presence in simultaneous multiplicities and eternal powers to redefine reality. The article argues in favour of incompleteness as a normal way of being. It challenges students of humanity to envisage a relationship between humans and digital technologies that is founded less on dichotomies and binary oppositions, nor on zero-sum games of conquest and superiority. If humans are present in things and things in humans, thanks to the interconnections, the flexibility and fluidity of being that come with recognition of and provision for incompleteness, it is important to see things and humans not only as intricately entangled, but also as open-ended composites. © 2019 Intellect Ltd Article.",Africa,Compositeness,Digital humanities,Digital technologies,ICTs,Incompleteness,Juju,Spyware,Nyamnjoh F.B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Claiming nearly 6 million readers monthly, the magazine’s profiles of cities, states and regions have the potential to reach the niche audiences that shape the spatial practices of firms and influence individual decisions on tourism expenditures. This paper explores how Sky promotes places in the text of these profiles through the dual use of digital humanities tools and close reading-based interpretation to address the following questions. First, we ask how is the South represented in the Sky profiles? Second, what themes are present in the profile texts, given that all places seek to address both unique elements while addressing common themes of importance to business? We find that place promotion practitioners use very similar themes that have been identified in the literature since the 1980s, primarily accessibility. Efforts to attract the creative class are also present in the Sky profiles. The South poses unique challenges to place marketers, and our findings show a convergence in how profiles tackle the concept of southern culture and identity as it is leveraged in many of the profiles. © 2019, University of North Carolina Press.

As a complement to close analysis of particular documents, network analysis can give a large-scale perspective on the history of science, identifying relational patterns across a vast number of documents that might otherwise require an entire career to digest. To demonstrate the power of the approach, the essay applies network theory to a corpus of publications in evolutionary medicine. Four distinct networks, including those focused on authors, keywords, and citations, quickly unearth a range of relevant historical information.

Through multimodal rhetorical analysis of data visualizations of migration, I examine the interplay of written-linguistic, visual, and spatial modes of communication deployed in two approaches to visualizing migration and propose that the contexts of collaboration behind their composition influence their representation of the migrant as a “problem” and hold the power to resist this narrative. © The Author(s) 2019.",composition,data visualization,digital humanities,digital rhetoric,mapping,migration,,,Risam R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first, a documentary edition of personal papers held by Peter Still, a former slave, was conceived as an independent research project involving the participation of two undergraduate research assistants; the second, based upon letters to and from the Rutgers College War Service Bureau (1917–1919), has been designed as a two-week text encoding unit in a proposed undergraduate course on data and culture. These two projects, both featuring the letter as their object of study, are compared and contrasted as models of data and process, affording reflections on the overlapping concerns of the library instruction and digital humanities communities of practice. I propose viewing text encoding projects, particularly those that focus on lesser known creators or on life documents such as letters, as a means of accessing both critical library pedagogy and digital humanities methodology. By developing such projects, librarians address a number of collection and instruction related objectives of the library, while offering a valuable introduction to a set of methods that are of increasing importance to undergraduate education. Furthermore, these projects may be conducted at smaller scales, by reusing and adapting methods and software shared by the digital humanities community, thereby limiting reliance on institutional partners for technology and infrastructure support, which may not be forthcoming in under-resourced institutional contexts. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Correspondence,Digital editions,Digital humanities pedagogy,Information literacy,Text Encoding Initiative (TEI),Undergraduate education,,,Giannetti F.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Metainformation scenarios in Digital Humanities: Characterization and conceptual modelling strategies,5,10.1016/j.is.2019.04.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065075624&doi=10.1016%2fj.is.2019.04.009&partnerID=40&md5=f4ae10ff7ad270b95b1024d161f0f3ad,"Requirements for the analysis, interpretation and reuse of information are becoming more and more ambitious as we generate larger and more complex datasets. This is leading to the development and widespread use of information about information, often called metainformation (or metadata) in most disciplines. The Digital Humanities are not an exception. We often assume that metainformation helps us in documenting information for future reference by recording who has created it, when and how, among other aspects. We also assume that recording metainformation will facilitate the tasks of interpreting information at later stages. However, some works have identified some issues with existing metadata approaches, related to 1) the proliferation of too many “standards” and difficulties to choose between them; 2) the generalized assumption that metadata and data (or metainformation and information) are essentially different, and the subsequent development of separate sets of languages and tools for each (introducing redundant models); and 3) the combination of conceptual and implementation concerns within most approaches, violating basic engineering principles of modularity and separation of concerns. Some of these problems are especially relevant in Digital Humanities. In addition, we argue here that the lack of characterization of the scenarios in which metainformation plays a relevant role in humanistic projects often results in metainformation being recorded and managed without a specific purpose in mind. In turn, this hinders the process of decision making on issues such as what metainformation must be recorded in a specific project, and how it must be conceptualized, stored and managed. This paper presents a review of the most used metadata approaches in Digital Humanities and, taking a conceptual modelling perspective, analyses their major issues as outlined above. It also describes what the most common scenarios for the use of metainformation in Digital Humanities are, presenting a characterization that can assist in the setting of goals for metainformation recording and management in each case. Based on these two aspects, a new approach is proposed for the conceptualization, recording and management of metainformation in the Digital Humanities, using the ConML conceptual modelling language, and adopting the overall view that metainformation is not essentially different to information. The proposal is validated in Digital Humanities scenarios through case studies employing real-world datasets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Conceptual modelling,ConML,Digital Humanities,Metadata,Metainformation,,,,Martin-Rodilla P.,Gonzalez-Perez C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on the theoretical frameworks of social spatialization and art as agency, the authors contend that variations in grave designs and materiality cannot simply be explained in terms of changes in fashion and mentality. Other factors also need to be taken into account. Using a digital data collection tool, the Cemetery Surveyor Application (CSA) developed at the University of Luxembourg, they compile a set of data encompassing all the material aspects of each grave in a cemetery in Luxembourg (Western Europe), the setting of their case study. The graves are dated from the 1850s to 2015. |The authors compare the chronological evolution of the most recurrent material features with a GIS-based spatial analysis of the same features. The results of the spatial analysis not only largely confirm the chronological study, but also allow them to be more precise (dating is often problematic) and include undated graves (a third of the sample). The digital data collection tool also allows them to compare cemeteries and to highlight variations in these that cannot merely be imputed to chronology, but also to spatial proximity and material agency. © The Author(s) 2019.",agency,cemetery,digital humanities,neighbouring effects,,,,,Streb C.K.,Kolnberger T.,Kmec S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model can be applied to a wide range of real-world data sets. Examples of multilayer networks can be found in the domains of life sciences, sociology, digital humanities and more. Within the domain of graph visualization, there are many systems which visualize data sets having many characteristics of multilayer graphs. This report provides a state of the art and a structured analysis of contemporary multilayer network visualization, not only for researchers in visualization, but also for those who aim to visualize multilayer networks in the domain of complex systems, as well as those developing systems across application domains. We have explored the visualization literature to survey visualization techniques suitable for multilayer graph visualization, as well as tools, tasks and analytic techniques from within application domains.

These terms acquired temporary value in a transition during the 19th century when a culture of research was established within a modern episteme. Beginning in the 20th century, this development was perceived as problematic, triggering criticism from philosophy and the arts, and even within the sciences. “Discipline,” “rigor,” and “systematic” have changed meanings over time, and recent contributions from digital humanities are promising for a renewed critical debate about rigor in research. Both digital humanities and quantitative research deal with big data sets aimed at providing a large-scale analysis. However, unlike most quantitative research, digital humanities explore uncertainties as their main focus. Attention to the human-machine collaboration has led to more expansive thinking in scientific research. Digital humanities go further by advancing a metaperspective that deals with the material hermeneutics of data accumulation itself. © The Author(s) 2019.",Digital humanities,new materialisms,research evaluation,rigor,validity,,,,Priem K.,Fendler L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, traditional or manual research methods are costly and cannot be applied on a large scale. This paper aims to present an exploratory study for understanding the cultural concerns of libraries based on the automatic analysis of large-scale image collections. Design/methodology/approach: In this work, an image dataset including 85,023 images preserved and shared by 28 libraries is collected from the Flickr Commons project. Then, a method is proposed for representing the culture with a distribution of visual semantic concepts using a state-of-the-art deep learning technique and measuring the cultural concerns of image collections using two metrics. Case studies on this dataset demonstrated the great potential and promise of the method for understanding large-scale image collections from the perspective of cultural concerns. Findings: The proposed method has the ability to discover important cultural units from large-scale image collections. The proposed two metrics are able to quantify the cultural concerns of libraries from different perspectives. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first automatic analysis of images for the purpose of understanding cultural concerns of libraries. The significance of this study mainly consists in the proposed method of understanding the cultural concerns of libraries based on the automatic analysis of the visual semantic concepts in image collections. Moreover, this paper has examined the cultural concerns (e.g. important cultural units, cultural focus, trends and volatility of cultural concerns) of 28 libraries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cultural concerns,Digital humanities,Image mining,Photograph-based culture understanding,Visual semantic concepts,,,,Ding H.,Lu W.,Jiang T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Visualizations that, purposely or not, obscure or remove uncertainty in its different forms from the scholars' vision may negatively affect the manner in which humanities scholars regard computational methods as useful tools in their daily work. In this paper, we address the issue of uncertainty representation in the context of the humanities from a theoretical perspective, in an attempt to provide the foundations of a framework that allows for the construction of ecological interface designs which are able to expose the computational power of the algorithms at play while, at the same time, respecting the particularities and needs of humanistic research. To this end, we review past uncertainty taxonomies in other domains typically related to the humanities and visualization, such as cartography and GIScience. From this review, we select an uncertainty taxonomy related to the humanities that we link to recent research in visualization for the DH. Finally, we bring a novel analytics method developed by other authors (Progressive Visual Analytics) into question, which we argue can be a good candidate to resolve the aforementioned difficulties in DH practice. © 2019 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

In contrast to standard levels of data quality in non-historical research domains, historical object and knowledge collections contain substantial amounts of uncertain, ambiguous, contested, or plainly missing data. Visualization approaches and interfaces to cultural collections have started to represent data quality and uncertainty metrics, yet all existing work is limited to representations for isolated metadata dimensions only. With this article, we advocate for a more systematic, synoptic and self-conscious approach to uncertainty visualization for cultural collections. We introduce omnipresent types of data uncertainty and discuss reasons for their frequent omission by interfaces for galleries, libraries, archives and museums. On this basis we argue for a coordinated counter strategy for uncertainty visualization in this field, which will also raise the efforts going into complex interface design and conceptualization. Building on the PolyCube framework for collection visualization, we showcase how multiple uncertainty representation techniques can be assessed and coordinated in a multi-perspective environment. As for an outlook, we reflect on both the strengths and limitations of making the actual wealth of data quality questions transparent with regard to different target and user groups. © 2019 MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

The tool uses vector space models together with theory-guided, empirically validated label lists to compute the valence of each word in a text by locating its position in a 2d emotion potential space spanned by the words of the vector space model. After testing the tool's accuracy with empirical data from a neurocognitive poetics study, it was applied to compute emotional figure and personality profiles (inspired by the so-called “big five” personality theory) for main characters from the book series. The results of comparative analyses using different machine-learning classifiers (e.g., AdaBoost, Neural Net) show that SentiArt performs very well in predicting the emotion potential of text passages. It also produces plausible predictions regarding the emotional and personality profile of fiction characters which are correctly identified on the basis of eight character features, and it achieves a good cross-validation accuracy in classifying 100 figures into “good” vs. “bad” ones. The results are discussed with regard to potential applications of SentiArt in digital literary, applied reading and neurocognitive poetics studies such as the quantification of the hybrid hero potential of figures. © Copyright © 2019 Jacobs.",computational poetics,digital humanities,emotional figure profile,hybrid hero potential,literary reading,machine learning,neuroaesthetics,sentiment analysis,Jacobs A.M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Digital Humanities project aims to translate cartographically the Furioso through the creation of interactive maps for each of the poem’s 46 cantos. This initiative in literary mapping is but the latest in a long tradition of visual and cartographic illustrations of the Furioso meant to supplement and elucidate the poem, helping readers to visualize and interpret the many intricately woven narrative strands and the vast geographic space that make up this dizzyingly complex work. The characters’ travels are traced onto Martin Waldseemüller’s contemporaneous world map that portrays a worldview in flux, facilitating an understanding of the interaction of the real and the fantastic in the poetic text, in the cartographic text, and in readers’ imaginations.

Magic lantern shows through a macroscopic lens: topic modelling and mapping as methods for media archaeology,0,10.1080/17460654.2019.1705651,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077887324&doi=10.1080%2f17460654.2019.1705651&partnerID=40&md5=60ca31b529de25e728c8d54e73e8f8ff,"This article explores trends across Lucerna, an online web resource for magic lantern materials, by combining two digital approaches: topic modelling and geospatial mapping. Topic modelling identifies words that occur most frequently together in a large corpus of texts through a form of statistical analysis. Using this method, I studied 2,000 descriptions of magic lantern shows given between 1874 and 1903. While there were records from Canada, India, and New Zealand in this data set, most of these lantern shows occurred in England. The groupings of words, or ‘topics’, reflected the prevalence of the Church Army, Band of Hope, and Sunday Schools in Lucerna’s textual record. Mapping these patterns revealed that descriptions of magic lantern shows were relatively uniform across the UK, suggesting that magic lantern shows in urban and rural spaces were represented similarly in periodical literature. Since the topics did not vary by region, I studied how the most prevalent topics differed by host organization and how they changed over time. The article finds that descriptions of lantern shows given by evangelistic organizations shared vocabulary with those hosted by Sunday Schools and temperance societies. It also shows that evangelistic shows tended to avoid the language of entertainment, echoing earlier discourse about the magic lantern on the mission field, and that the decline in topics related to Sunday Schools over time corresponds with the rise of educational lantern lectures, particularly those given by secular institutions like the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. Overall, the article suggests that topic modelling can be used to excavate the performance history of lantern shows by foregrounding latent linguistic similarities in published descriptions of these events. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",data mining,database design,digital humanities,digitisation,geographic information systems,LDA,Magic lantern shows,mapping,Borgo Ton M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This essay tackles the question based on practical, hands-on experiences that the author obtained through testing a method for digitising lantern slides. The digital copies achieved in digitisation projects, the author argues, are never a matter of mere documentation that produce ‘evidence’ about or ‘neutral/objective copies’ of the analogue objects but are results of interpretation, selection processes and modelling, informed by the aim of the digitisation project and the perspective of the person carrying out the work. As a case study, this article provides a material basis for theoretical, conceptual and epistemological reflections on the relation of analogue and digitised (media) objects, adding to current digital humanities discussions on tool criticism and source critique of digital objects. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

He is the chief editor of Palgrave Macmillan's Geocriticism and Spatial Literary Studies book series. He has published extensively in Literary Cartography, Marxist criticism and World Literature. Dr. Yuan Yuan, while working as a visiting scholar at UC, Berkeley (2018-2019), interviewed Professor Tally at the 2019 Modern Language Association of America Convention in Chicago and sought his opinions on some of the major issues in Spatial Literary Studies: 1) theoretical genealogy; 2) possibility of dialogue between Chinese and Western scholars in this academic field; 3) pedagogy; and 4) tendencies in future development. Tally emphasizes the inborn interdisciplinarity of Spatial Literary Studies. He believes that place-mindedness prevails on three different levels: writing, reading, and criticism. He points out the problem with Bertrand Westphal's geocentric approach and argues against the negative influence of digital humanities represented by Stanford Literary Lab. However, he sees possible interfaces among Spatial Literary Studies and AI studies, Narratology, Ecocriticism, and so on. Literature teachers can arrange field trips and adopt other approaches to Affective Geography in their courses. The interview thus inspires a reemphasis of the Marxist approach which is interdisciplinary, comprehensive, dialectical, and full of humanity in its essence. © Copyright by Foreign Literature Studies.

A Chinese ancient book digital humanities research platform to support digital humanities research,7,10.1108/EL-10-2018-0213,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067009122&doi=10.1108%2fEL-10-2018-0213&partnerID=40&md5=f3730f42435131f10dbcc0a9c2ee5ce9,"Purpose: With the rapid development of digital humanities, some digital humanities platforms have been successfully developed to support digital humanities research for humanists. However, most of them have still not provided a friendly digital reading environment and practicable social network analysis tool to support humanists on interpreting texts and exploring characters’ social network relationships. Moreover, the advancement of digitization technologies for the retrieval and use of Chinese ancient books is arising an unprecedented challenge and opportunity. For these reasons, this paper aims to present a Chinese ancient books digital humanities research platform (CABDHRP) to support historical China studies. In addition to providing digital archives, digital reading, basic search and advanced search functions for Chinese ancient books, this platform still provides two novel functions that can more effectively support digital humanities research, including an automatic text annotation system (ATAS) for interpreting texts and a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) for exploring characters’ social network relationships. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted DSpace, an open-source institutional repository system, to serve as a digital archives system for archiving scanned images, metadata, and full texts to develop the CABDHRP for supporting digital humanities (DH) research. Moreover, the ATAS developed in the CABDHRP used the Node.js framework to implement the system’s front- and back-end services, as well as application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by different databases, such as China Biographical Database (CBDB) and TGAZ, used to retrieve the useful linked data (LD) sources for interpreting ancient texts. Also, Neo4j which is an open-source graph database management system was used to implement the CSNRMT of the CABDHRP. Finally, JavaScript and jQuery were applied to develop a monitoring program embedded in the CABDHRP to record the use processes from humanists based on xAPI (experience API). To understand the research participants’ perception when interpreting the historical texts and characters’ social network relationships with the support of ATAS and CSNRMT, semi-structured interviews with 21 research participants were conducted. Findings: An ATAS embedded in the reading interface of CABDHRP can collect resources from different databases through LD for automatically annotating ancient texts to support digital humanities research. It allows the humanists to refer to resources from diverse databases when interpreting ancient texts, as well as provides a friendly text annotation reader for humanists to interpret ancient text through reading. Additionally, the CSNRMT provided by the CABDHRP can semi-automatically identify characters’ names based on Chinese word segmentation technology and humanists’ support to confirm and analyze characters’ social network relationships from Chinese ancient books based on visualizing characters’ social networks as a knowledge graph. The CABDHRP not only can stimulate humanists to explore new viewpoints in a humanistic research, but also can promote the public to emerge the learning interest and awareness of Chinese ancient books. Originality/value: This study proposed a novel CABDHRP that provides the advanced features, including the automatic word segmentation of Chinese text, automatic Chinese text annotation, semi-automatic character social network analysis and user behavior analysis, that are different from other existed digital humanities platforms. Currently, there is no this kind of digital humanities platform developed for humanists to support digital humanities research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Automatic text annotation,Character social networks analysis,Chinese ancient books,Digital archives,Digital humanities,,,,Chen C.-M.,Chang C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We currently face the challenge of the development of reading strategies that oscillate between “close” and “distant” reading. For years, these reading strategies have been a topic of debate between practitioners of Digital Humanities on the one hand, and “traditional” humanists on the other. This ongoing polemics presents reading methods in an unnecessarily polarized manner. I argue that creativity research can be operationalized to come to a more productive model to characterize the ways we read in an information age. I show that the “schism” between close and distant reading is structured around a number of apparent paradoxes that I unravel such as hyper- and deep attention/attention and distraction, and convergence and divergence. The paradox of creativity resides in the fact that we find convergence in divergence and vice versa, that the two by definition intertwine. Building on these concepts, I propose a model that considers reading in terms of scale variance. I suggest the humanities turn to creativity research and the interrelations between divergent-exploratory and convergent-integrative thinking (Lubart), for a conceptual framework that will allow us to train students on all levels how to read (and how and when not to read), in an information age. © 2017 by the Creative Education Foundation, Inc.",attention,convergence,creativity,digital humanities,divergence,information,reading,,van de Ven I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most techniques used to represent data vagueness emerged from natural sciences, and lack the expressiveness that would be ideal for humanistic contexts. Building on previous work, we present here a conceptual framework based on the ConML modelling language for the expression of information vagueness in digital humanities. In addition, we propose an implementation on non-relational data stores, which are becoming popular within the digital humanities. Having clear implementation guidelines allow us to employ search engines or big data systems (commonly implemented using non-relational approaches) to handle the vague aspects of information. The proposed implementation guidelines have been validated in practice, and show how we can query a vagueness-aware system without a large penalty in analytical and processing power. © 2019 by the authors.",Conceptual modelling,ConML,Digital humanities,Imprecision,Knowledge representation,Non-relational databases,Uncertainty,Vagueness,Martin-Rodilla P.,Gonzalez-Perez C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result is both widespread apathy toward nonproliferation and disarmament decision making among the general public and a looming personnel crisis within government sectors that enact policy in these domains. Considering that 67 percent of high school graduates in the United States go on to pursue a bachelor’s degree, exposing more undergraduates to nonproliferation and disarmament issues could contribute to addressing both of these challenges. The present study analyzes how these issues are already being taught at select US colleges and universities and explores ways to introduce them to more students that align with current priorities in higher education, such as interdisciplinary learning, digital humanities, and data-science learning. It also proposes concrete steps that the WMD policy community can take to help institutions of higher education integrate these topics more broadly into their curricula. The anticipated result is greater support for education in this important issue area across different stakeholders in academia, as well as increased engagement with these critical issues among a more diverse population of young people. © 2019, © 2019 Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.",data-science learning,digital learning,disarmament,education,interdisciplinary learning,nonproliferation,United States,,Bidgood S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are interestingly close to the cultural techniques that preside to the production of knowledge and to art-related practices, such as curating, exhibiting and critique, which seems to bring testimony to the triumph of the so-called ‘knowledge society’ and ‘creative economy’. But, while both scientific knowledge and cultural industry are rapidly relying on algorithms, automated analysis and data visualisation to deal with the exponential growth of data, cultural institutions and humanities are still struggling to decide in what terms are they going to enter the digital age, although they are already being transformed through the infrastructure of digital archives and digital media. This proposal will reflect upon the meaning of activities such as curating, displaying and critique, that have shaped the worlds of art and culture over the last century and upon their redefinition by the mathematics and geometry that are developping the new information geographies of the cultural economy. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Contemprary art,critique,curation,data analysis,data visualisation,digital humanities,,,Cruz M.T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article explores this question with reference to the archive of Professor Germaine Greer: Australian-born feminist, performer, scholar, and professional controversialist. It does so by staging two very different data encounters with the 70,000-word finding aid for the print journalism series, a key component of Greer’s archive. The first encounter is archivist’s creation of the finding aid; the second, archivist and literary scholar’s interpretation of this archival metadata using sentiment analysis. Interrogating these activities side-by-side opens up a productive middle ground between humanities scholars and computer technicians, between historians and archivists, between the hand made and the machine made. This article argues that sentiment analysis offers a new and highly productive method of interrogating archival metadata, and that, as a method which privileges emotive understandings of content, it is particularly appropriate to the study of feminist archives like Greer’s. It also argues that these kinds of detailed finding aids are new datasets that reward analysis in their own right, and particularly when considered in dialogue with—rather than simply used as straightforward navigational tools for—the ‘original’ archival content. © 2019 Millicent Weber and Rachel Buchanan.",Digital humanities,Germaine Greer,Journalism,Metadata,Newspaper history,Sentiment analysis,,,Weber M.,Buchanan R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Digging into Data 3 challenge (DID3) (2014–2016) is an international, interdisciplinary and collaborative grant initiative, and the purpose of this paper is to explore skills that faculty and students brought to projects and others they acquired and shared on collaborative teams. Design/methodology/approach: Rooted in the naturalistic paradigm, this qualitative case study centers on semi-structured interviews with 53 participants on 11 of the 14 DID3 projects. Documentary evidence complements empirical evidence; analysis is constructivist and grounded. Findings: Hailing from diverse academic research institutions, centers and repositories, participants brought 20 types of discipline-based or interdisciplinary expertise to DID3 projects. But they reported acquiring or refining 27 other skills during their project work. While most are data-related, complementary programming, management and analytical skills push disciplinary expertise toward new frontiers. Project-based learning and pedagogy function symbiotically; participants therefore advocate for aligning problem-solving skills with pedagogical objectives at home institutions to prepare for public-funded DH projects. A modified content analysis juxtaposes DID3 skills with those advanced in 23 recent DH syllabi to identify commonalities and gaps. Originality/value: Pedagogy has an important yet under-researched and underdeveloped role in public-funded DH research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data handling,Data literacy,Digital humanities pedagogy,Information and library science,Information literacy,Public-funded research,Skills,,Garwood D.A.,Poole A.H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it increasingly difficult to manage, access and utilize the data to ultimately gain scientific insights based on it. At the same time, domain scientists want to focus on their science instead of IT. The solution is research data management to store data in a structured way enabling easy discovery for future reference and usage. An integral part is the use of metadata. With it, data becomes accessible by its content and context instead of its name and location only. The use of metadata shall be as automatic and seamless as possible in order to foster a high usability. Here, we present the architecture and developments of the Metadata Management for Applied Sciences (MASi) project that is currently building a comprehensive research data management service. MASi extends the existing KIT Data Manager framework by a generic metadata programming interface and a generic graphical web interface. Furthermore, MASi is OAI compliant and supports the OAI-PMH protocol while providing support for provenance information using ProvONE, a well-established and accepted provenance model. To illustrate the practical applicability of the MASi service, we present the adoption of initial use cases within geography, chemistry and digital humanities. The MASi research data management service is currently being prepared to go into production to satisfy the complex and varying requirements in an efficient, useable and sustainable way. © 2018 The Authors",Communities,Metadata,Research data management,,,,,,Grunzke R.,Hartmann V.,Jejkal T.,Kollai H.,Prabhune A.,Herold H.,Deicke A.,Dressler C.,Dolhoff J.,Stanek J.,Hoffmann A.,Müller-Pfefferkorn R.,Schrade T.,Meinel G.,Herres-Pawlis S.,Nagel W.E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having provided a wide room for technological devices to read and account for elements of a text, it portrays the exercise within the scope of Digital Humanities (DH). The theory, championed by Halliday, describes a text from its systemic configurations to chain structures and social relationship frameworks. To explain the weight of SFG as an interface between text and technology, the author chose a poem, 'Area Boy', in which three perspectives of the mood system, thematic system, and transitivity system are instrumental to expose its nuances. The approach was followed by correlating the three systems together as a comparative analysis. The study reveals that 'Area Boy' operates in declarative clauses with heavy utilization of Subject and Finite. These are organized in marked themes. The contents of the text are represented in material processes (e.g. spent) with supports from both mental (e.g. remember) and verbal (e.g. said) processes. Some of the processes along with circumstances (e.g. Of washing , Now that ) recur as repetitions for emphatic and enhancement purposes. On the one hand, the article concludes that SFG can assist in interpreting textual elements to generate meaning potential. On the other hand, through the SFG's metafunctional applications to 'Area Boy', one can suggest that the society should give a helping hand to the less privileged. Such a behavior can eradicate vices experienced through the 'Area Boys' from the society. © 2019 The Author(s).",Area Boy',Digital Humanities,Mood System,Systemic Functional Grammatics,Thematic System,Transitivity System,,,Dalamu T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The workings of anamorphosis show that repetition and retrospection are necessary procedures for DH. Considering DH from the skewed perspective of anamorphosis allows us to recast DH, situating it within a media history that stretches back into the Middle Ages. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",anamorphosis,desire,digital humanities (DH),Lacan,perspective,praxis,theory,,Sparks C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This essay contends that communication scholars can support the growing “case for the humanities” by analyzing argumentative strategies, and more specifically, by offering ethical argumentative strategies that avoid replicating structures of domination. In particular, we look to Mari Lee Mifsud’s theorization of rhetoric as gift, which follows Henry W. Johnstone in conceptualizing argument as something other than winning over an adversary. We place Mifsud’s theorization of the gift in conversation with the methods of the digital public humanities (DPH), which acknowledge and offer abundant resources for meaning-making. Through the methods of DPH, we offer a response to the humanities “crisis” that activates the humanities’ already broad constituencies by giving resources for humanistic inquiry rather than seeking to capture adversaries. Our case study is Photogrammar, a DPH project for organizing, searching, and visualizing the New Deal and World War II era photographs funded by the U.S. federal government. The project forefronts visual, nonlinear, and interactive argumentation in order to engage publics in generative humanistic inquiry. By enlisting participants and sharing expertise, Photogrammar shows how humanities advocates can deepen attachments to the humanities and build broad constituencies of collaborators and allies. © 2019 National Communication Association.",Argument,Digital humanities,Photogrammar,Public humanities,Rhetorical theory,,,,Cox J.,Tilton L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To answer this question, we need to ask what are the critical questions in art history that demand and are best suited to specific digital methods? This article argues that asking a critical question involves taking up the long art-historical tradition of the social history of art. Social art history is not satisfied with a social context for art, but rather reverses this equation by arguing that an analysis of art, artist, and audience must tell us something structurally about society. It is these kinds of questions that critically engage in broader art-historical debates. When questions such as these rely on large bodies of evidence – which they often do if “society” is their focus of study – then the scale of the project is, in today’s context, best suited for digital methods. In sum, digital art history lets us address the tradition of the social history of art in new ways. The following essay seeks to advance a nuanced triangulation between our art-historical topics of study, our methodological debates, and computational analysis. In specific terms, exploring alternative subjects of art history as well as the particular analytical methods of social art history opens up the debates in the discipline to a more critical intervention with digital methods. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Alan turing (1912-1954),Arnold Hauser (1892-1978),Digital humanities,German architecture,Methodology,Social art history,,,Jaskot P.B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The curriculum aims at guiding students to reflect on multicultural values, learn about holistic education, and focus on people's core concerns. Ritual part of Taiwan’s Atayal and Thao cultures are integrated into the innovative education of indigenous literature, and students are led to participate in field investigations of the ceremonies to complete the digital cultural documentary of the Atayal Thanksgiving ceremony and reach the innovative teaching goal of digital humanities education.

The question is popular for scholars working in the realm of critical discourse analysis (CDA). Their typical approach is qualitative, which involves dissecting a small number of texts at the microlinguistic level. This approach has over the years come under severe criticisms for the lack of objective and reliable empirical evidence it produces for the sweeping claims it makes about the relationship between language and social structures. In response to such criticisms, the discipline has recently been embracing corpus linguistics as a way of making up for its methodological weaknesses. Yet, the corpus techniques applied to CDA have so far been largely confined to collocation and concordance analysis. Despite their proven value, these techniques are not optimal for investigating the overall topic structure and content of media texts because they are primarily designed to probe lexical relationships. Digital humanities have over the years developed a range of effective tools for analyzing the content of a large population of texts. The present study applies two such tools, co-occurrence analysis and topic modeling coupled with network analysis, to analyzing a corpus of Korean straight news reports. The analyses were effective in uncovering five major topics or themes underlying the news corpus, thereby proving the usefulness of the techniques used for the type of CDA questions explored in this article. © The Author(s) 2018.

Here, we describe seven digitally-based projects we have undertaken at the University of Pennsylvania in order to create new tools for archaeological data collection and sharing, as well as to test collaborative models for the digital humanities programming process. In these projects, archaeology students work directly with engineering students. Through this interface, the students from both areas gain valuable transdisciplinary experience while experimenting with new ways to accomplish programming goals and to collect archaeological data.

Through two case studies, this article explores the use of crowd-sourcing in order to develop digital tools that amplify women and provide them with a firmer online identity. The first, Wikipedia.org, is already entrenched in the popular research realm, and the second, WOAH (Women of Ancient History), is currently being developed as a reference tool. Wikipedia.org is the most influential source of knowledge in the world, but it has a stubborn gender bias against women. This distortion is particularly evident in the field of classics, where prior to 2017 only 7% of biographies of classicists featured women. Here, 'classics' is an inclusive term, and is broadly conceived to include the field of Late Antiquity. This short article details how the Women's Classical Committee (UK)'s Wikipedia editing initiative, #WCCWiki, and the development of WOAH, have successfully increased the visibility of women online. Consequently, it offers a model to mobilize change with few physical or financial resources, but rather facilitated by digital tools and social media. Through digital feminist activism, there is the potential to reverse the gender skew of classicists online and in the public discourse, while also creating an inclusive space that is professional, proactive, and accessible to all. © 2019 by the Regents of the University of California.",Activism,Classics,Digital humanities,Gender bias,Geographic information systems,Network analysis,Online,Wikipedia,Leonard V.,Bond S.E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Historians have debated the historical accuracy of these accounts, often making some reference to acoustics, either supporting or refuting the accounts, but without any numerical justification. The field of digital humanities, and more specifically archaeoacoustics, seeks to use computational techniques to provide empirical data to improve historical analysis. Julius Caesar recalled giving speeches to 14,000 men after the battle of Dyrrachium and another to 22,000 men before the battle of Pharsalus during the Roman Civil War. Caesar’s background and education are discussed, including his training in rhetoric and oratory, which would have affected his articulation and effective sound pressure level while addressing his troops. Based on subjective reports about Caesar’s oratorical abilities, his effective Sound Pressure Level (SPL) is assumed to be 80 dBA, about 6 dB above the average loud speaking voice but lower than that of the loudest trained actors and singers. Simulations show that for reasonable background noise conditions Caesar could have been heard intelligibly by 14,000 soldiers in a quiet, controlled environment as in the speech at Dyrrachium. In contrast, even granting generous acoustic and geometric conditions, Caesar could not have been heard by more than about 700 soldiers while his army was on the march before the battle of Pharsalus. © 2018 by the authors.

The author holds that the rise of “posthumanism” in the West during the past decades indicates that in the present era, man, like those living animals and plants on the earth, is nothing but one of the species in nature, whose existence and development to a large extent depend on natural law. It is true that posthumanism came after the crisis of humanism, but it has continuity with and transcends over the latter. It informs us that over-evaluating the role of man is by no means adequate, for man has entered into a “posthuman” stage, in which man is no longer viewed as the only species that has rational thought, nor is he the head of all the species on the earth. But man can create various wonders, some of which are even beyond man’s control. Although the rise of posthumanism has raised a severe challenge and even threat to traditional humanism and human existence, the author still hopefully finds some prospects for mankind, especially in current China where a sort of ecocivilization should be built up and digital humanities may well bridge up the gap between science and humanities. © 2018, Fudan University.",Digital humanities,Ecocriticism,Humanism,Posthumanism,Science and technology,,,,Wang N.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They may struggle to grasp the role that research plays in probing questions about the relationships between people, places, and events that compose complex historical periods. This article describes a collaboration between an art history professor, a librarian, and a digital humanities specialist in which students were taught how to conduct research for an art history course on German art 1900 to the present and then visualize that research through story maps created with ArcGIS. Through these mapping projects, students were encouraged to engage with the history of German art on a physical level by mapping spatial relationships between social networks, artists’ studios, exhibition venues, art museums, architecture, and other important historical sites that were integral to the development of major art movements. This case study article outlines the project, including its learning outcomes, pedagogical strategies, student products, and assessment data. In addition, it describes how the project developed through different iterations. Ultimately, this collaborative, interdisciplinary project may provide a model for ways that visualization in general and map creation in particular can be used as a teaching strategy to make art history come alive for students by opening new conceptual territory, prompting intriguing questions, generating unique answers, and engaging art history in a more physical, spatial manner. © 2019 by The Art Libraries Society of North America.

This article examines the POCC model in relation to three creation projects that employ(ed) it for the production of literary and artistic content. It argues that the use of the POCC model has given rise to a new form of collaborative authorship that is inclusive and dynamic and as such cannot be adequately captured within the traditional notion of collaborative authorship currently recognized by copyright law.

Design/methodology/approach: The CH and instruction domains are logically deconstructed into dimensions of functions, semiotics, CH, teaching/instructional materials, agents and outcomes. The elements within those dimensions can be concatenated to create natural-English sentences that describe aspects of the problem domain. Findings: The framework is valid using traditional social sciences content, semantic, practical and systemic validity constructs. Research limitations/implications: The framework can be used to map current research literature to discover areas of heavy, light and no research. Originality/value: The framework provides a new way for CH and education stakeholders to describe and visualize the problem domain, which could allow for significant enhancements of each. Better understanding the problem domain would serve to enhance instruction informed from collections and vice versa. The educational process would have more depth due to better access to primary sources. Increased use of collections would reveal more ways through which they could be used in instruction. The framework can help visualize the past and present of the domain, and envisage its future. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Academic libraries – relations with faculty,archives and museums,Curriculum,Digital humanities,Digital libraries,Galleries,Higher education,Information literacy,Yaco S.,Ramaprasad A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our quantitative and explorative analysis of library catalogs from the National Library of Sweden and the National Library of Finland we identify the general trends in publishing, how book-printing has been affected by political events, and how printing developed at different paces in different parts of the realm. We have developed a new method for analyzing the totality of publishing through extensive data harmonization and comprehensive statistical analysis, and by treating library catalogs not as an endpoint of bibliographic research but as an inherently rich source of information. This facilitated the quantitative assessment of printing in the Swedish realm based on the metadata contained in library catalogs. Our data-driven approach to the transformation of public discourse demonstrates that whereas the amount of printed material grew steadily, political ruptures affected the development of printing.

Thousands of volunteers are using LibriVox to collaboratively produce free audiobook versions of texts in the US public domain. The work of finding, selecting, and preparing texts to be digitized and published in audio form is complex and slow, and not all of this labor is ultimately visible, valued, or rewarded. Drawing on an ethnographic study of 12 years of archived discourse and documentation, I interrogate digital traces of the processes by which several LibriVox versions of Anne of Green Gables have come into being, watching for ways in which policies and infrastructure have been influenced by variously visible and invisible forms of work. Making visible the intricate, unique, archived experiences of the crowdsourcing community of LibriVox volunteers and their tools adds to still-emerging discussions about how to value extra-institutional, public, distributed digital humanities work. © 2019, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

More specifically, the author discusses a key moment in the semester where students needed to move between university and non-university technology infrastructures in order to create multiplayer gamespaces that were accessible to their peers. In narrating this experience, the author will demonstrate how a discourse of “access” can be used to examine the oftinvisible policies, procedures, and restrictions that shape the way we compose, circulate and make visible digitally-native work. Furthermore, the author will discuss how a critical emphasis on “access” can help teachers and students better mediate the relationship between internal or university-supplied technological infrastructures and external platforms when creating interactive digital projects. The underlying motivation of this essay is not to lambaste universities for lack of institutional support nor is it to champion commercial organizations as saviors for helping teachers successfully use digital platforms in the classroom. Instead, the goal of this brief essay is to spur discussions surrounding the following questions: how might we use issues regarding access to better examine and navigate the hard-to-define boundaries that separate university-sanction technology use from non-university sanctioned technology use? How might calling students' attention to access refine the larger learning objectives for Digital Humanities or DH-related courses? © 2019, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

For us, the answer to these questions lies in privileging the pedagogical affordances of data construction by crafting a workflow that included undergraduates as intellectual partners, and using DH methods to visualize and make public this collaborative labor. By drawing on our work with Photogrammar, which visualizes federal New Deal documentary projects including photography and life histories, we highlight three strategies for making labor visible in the digital humanities. First, we discuss how this project served as a tool for teaching undergraduate students key methods in DH by giving them experience with conducting original research with credit on the public site. In this way, we explain how pedagogy can become a part of project development. Second, we argue that DH visualization techniques can make the labor behind DH projects visible. We focus on how Photogrammar uses a timeline and network analysis alongside the traditional “About” page to make visible all participants in the project. Third, we turn to an open discussion of the challenges faced in the politics of attribution when working with university, governmental and private historical organizations, including domain names and the use of organizational logos. © 2019, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

In this paper we reflect on the difficulties posed by this work, and we argue that it is a serious challenge which ought to be taken up within the digital humanities and related efforts to computationally support scholarly practice. Network analysis, bibliometrics, and stylometrics, essentially leave out the fundamental humanistic skill of charitable argument interpretation because they touch very little on the meanings embedded in texts.

To begin, we review the discussion of digital humanities labs in the literature: digital humanities institutional models, how these models are practiced, lab funding, and the resultant position of labs as sites of training for graduate students. From there, we offer a teaching case from the Lab’s fall 2015 “Stories from Data” workshop in order to render visible a set of principles to guide professionalization of graduate students in the digital humanities lab.

In the interest of collaborating more effectively with increasingly larger and more multidisciplinary research communities, we move outward from that specific collaboration to explore one of the ways that such research is characterized in the domain of software engineering-the ISO/IEC 25010:2011 standard. Although not a perfect fit with discourses of value in the humanities, it provides a possible starting point for forging shared vocabularies within the research collaboratory.

Analysis draws on quantitative information made possible by the recent advances in the application of digital humanities research techniques to the study of the Spanish comedia, including a new database of assonance in Calderón under preparation as well as the paradigm-setting Manos database. Additional insights emerge from a newly available manuscript of Eco y Narciso that had long been unavailable to scholars.

The model uses the advantages and possibilities of two subjects, Geography and German, in order to achieve the greatest possible educational value. The topic ‘Linguistic Landscapes’ represents just one of many intersections of the two subjects and, especially in the digital world, has potential for a wide range of applications. Because language takes place in space, it can be argued that language in its visible form in particular – for example on city streets – contributes to the shaping of the landscape.

In particular, the essay responds to the tendency to focus on “DH in the moment” (projects that can be done quickly and yield a high social impact) as the primary form of activism, arguing that alongside such projects we include as activist projects that have a more cumulative and less immediate effect.

While some projects to ameliorate this situation have emerged in recent years, using software to create machine-readable results from medieval manuscripts is still in its infancy. This article presents the results of a series of successful experiments with open-source neural network OCR software on medieval manuscripts. Results over the course of these experiments yielded character and word accuracy rates over 90%, reaching 94% and 97% accuracy in some instances. Such results are not only viable for creating machine-readable texts but also pose new avenues for bringing together manuscript studies and digital humanities in ways previously unrealized.

Librarians at Stony Brook University Libraries host Open Mic events for digital humanities researchers, teachers, and students on campus. Inspired by a desire to better serve digital humanists with existing projects, this event was initially organized to increase the visibility of scholars and students with nascent projects and connect these digital humanists to library supported resources and to one another. For the Libraries, the Open Mic was an opportunity to understand the scope and practices of the digital humanities community at Stony Brook, and to identify ways to make meaningful interventions. An open mic is a uniquely suitable event format in that it embodies a dynamic, permissive, multidisciplinary presentation space that is as much for exercising new and ongoing research (and technologies) as it is for making discoveries and connections. The success of these events can be measured in the establishment of the University Libraries as a nexus for digital humanities work, consultations, instruction, workshops, and community on a campus without a designated digital humanities center.

In the English of Shakespeare's time, the now-archaic distinction between you and thou persisted, and is usually reported as being determined by relative social status and personal closeness of speaker and addressee. However, it remains to be determined whether statistical machine learning will support this traditional explanation. 23 features are investigated, having been selected from multiple linguistic areas, such as pragmatics, sociolinguistics and conversation analysis. The three algorithms used, Naive Bayes, decision tree and support vector machine, are selected as illustrative of a range of possible models in light of their contrasting assumptions and learning biases. Two predictions are performed, firstly on a binary (you/thou) distinction and then on a trinary (you/thou/thee) distinction. Of the three algorithms, the support vector machine models score best. The features identified as the best predictors of pronoun choice are the words in the direct linguistic context.

Reality check for quantitative Dutch linguistics: navigating between the Scylla of conservatism and the Charybdis of complacency,2,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085705418&partnerID=40&md5=4a9d9717ded8231a08ee73800b173139,"In this article, we assess the merits of Digital Humanities, and argue that this approach has advanced the field of Dutch linguistics considerably, but at the same time holds some dangers and misconceptions, like (i) the assumption that the new-fangled studies clash with older, more traditional research, (ii) a conceited but unwarranted disdain for current-day non-quantitative work, (iii) the idea that the early adoption of quantitative methods in linguistics created an unbridgeable gap with its neighbouring discipline, the literary studies, and (iv) the risk of the di-alectics of lead. We then detect the weak spot of the Digital Humanities approach in linguistics. Though we acknowledge that great strides are currently being made and that earlier research grappled with the issue as well, what turns out to be frus-tratingly elusive is the whole field of ‘semantics’, especially given the insights from cognitive linguistics about its complicated nature, including encyclopaedic and contextual knowledge. The aporia of semantics is coped with differently in linguistics and literature. While linguistics has sought a rapprochement with the ex-act sciences, it steered clear from interpretation as much as possible. The field of literary studies, by contrast, remains loyal to its original ‘humanities’ mission, but is now no longer exclusively – or primarily – driven by critically interpreting the meaning of texts as such. Instead, its focus has shifted to offering a critical investigation of the field itself, and of society at large. Both approaches are in danger of derailing: the ‘semanticophobia’ of some linguists dismisses a real and fascinating part of language from its purview; the ‘critical discourse’ approach of some literary colleagues runs the risk of ignoring some useful text-based techniques for empirical research. The main task of Digital Humanities, in both fields, will be to navi-gate between these pitfalls. © 2019, Uitgeverij Verloren BV.

We argue that computational work in the Digital Humanities goes well beyond some utilitarian service to a perceived ‘humanities proper’. It is proper academic research in which computational models are expressions of theory. We explain that it is often hard for humanists to appreciate such forms of theory as they are indeed very differently expressed than more conventional abductive humanities reasoning. Nonetheless, thorough and viable theories result from Digital Humanities intellectual work, which includes the labor to produce software and computational models. We propose that all these forms of theory should not be separate from each other. Instead we strive for a strong reciprocal relation between new computational modeling and existing hermeneutics. This is a holistic approach inspired by the New Sociology of Art in which we relate the computational analysis of text immanent features to sociological processes and existing literary theory. We demonstrate this approach with an example from our current project ‘The Riddle of Literary Quality’. We explain how this is an approach of many small analytical steps carefully building upon each other. Finally we suggest that many of the unproductive misunderstandings between computational and conventional research approaches could be mitigated by increased attention in curricula syllabi for currently developing methods. © 2019, Uitgeverij Verloren BV.

Computational narratology: 'Structuralism strikes back' or new answers to new questions?,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084228868&partnerID=40&md5=9a58e6f0075b69c98068483019b5290f,"The article aims to explore methodological tenets and options underpinning the ongoing development of computational narratology. So far, the digital turn in narrative studies seems to have been dominated by a return to early formalist and proto-structuralist accounts of story grammar (Propp). However, it is shown that aspects of discourse and style have been latent in approaches to distant reading outside of narrative studies. The application of digital humanities to narrative studies requires us to abandon a staple of literary theory: the alleged oppositions between between system and performance, between structure and pragmatics, autonomy and heteronomy etc. This means that aspects of the paratext and a multimodal take on the setting of narrative are likely to feed into the digital analysis of narrative, but also that categories hitherto considered to be formalist turn out to rely on interpretation. The article then takes a look at the purport of sentiment mining, network analysis and co-reference resolution for digital (literary) narrative studies. Finally, it is argued that the anti-computationalism of second-generation cognitive theory (currently dominant in narrative studies) is in fact a misnomer, as the tenets of embodied cognitionn are in fact highly amenable to the study of the actual reception and comprehension of narratives via digital tools. © 2019, Uitgeverij Verloren BV.

Reading texts in such languages even with dictionaries is quite challenging. It is difficult to identify the lemma of a word form occurring in texts, which one could look up in a dictionary. The need for additional grammatical information about a word (classes of declension, conjugation, etc.) poses another problem. The Lexicographic Centre at Ivanè Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University (TSU) has embarked on creating a fully digitalized, web-based chrestomathy of Gothic and Anglo-Saxon texts with dictionaries and grammatical paradigms integrated in it, which would facilitate the study of these linguistically important languages. Each word of the digital versions of Gothic and Anglo-Saxon texts is hyperlinked to the corresponding headword from the dictionary. The dictionary entry itself, in addition to the meaning of the word, provides via another hyperlink all necessary information concerning the morphological class and inflectional patterns of the word in question. The paper describes the structure of the Chrestomathy and its modus operandi; analyses the dictionary component of the online resource and some lexicographic solutions; discusses lexicological and technical aspects of the online resource, etc. The method applied in the Chrestomathy can be successfully used in developing similar resources for extant, morphologically complex languages characterized with the abundance of inflectional and suppletive forms, such as Hungarian, Turkish, Russian, German, Georgian and many others. © 2019 Bureau of the WAT.

On literary urban studies,0,10.7592/methis.v19i24.16196,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083822704&doi=10.7592%2fmethis.v19i24.16196&partnerID=40&md5=53af50273fc4dac5d162e604494d4df4,"In the 2010s, a new Literary Urban Studies (hereafter LUS) has developed. It combines spatial humanities scholarship with activism and other public concerns. The Association for Literary Urban Studies (ALUS) has been a key player in developing the new LUS. Publications produced by scholars connected to ALUS have been geographically wide-ranging. They have also developed interests in specific concep-tual areas of LUS, including second cities and ‘citiness’, or the cultural elements that are specific to the city and the urban condition. Key issues arising from contemporary ‘citiness’ include the operation of networks, scales and hierarchies in urban cultures. Walter Benjamin called Paris the ‘capital of the nineteenth century’, but LUS looks beyond cities judged the most primary or alpha-level. Studies in the new LUS so far produced engage with and practice urban history and urban planning studies, applying literary reading techniques to texts not commonly judged literary (incuding policy and planning texts, or trial transcripts). Literature has a particular potential for urban planners and activists as a means of staging possibilities for one city or all cities. Despite these boundary-crossing inclinations, LUS is coherent and distinctive. This can be shown by contrasting it with several other activities that somewhat resemble it. LUS belongs in the academic humanities, not with urban studies, in the interdisciplinary social sciences. It is in part an outgrowth of the ‘spatial turn’ associated with names like Lefebvre, de Certeau and Anglophone critical geogra-phers, but it does not consider cities as mere instances of spatiality, however socially produced. It draws on phenomenological accounts of placed human experience but juxtaposes individuals’ perspectives with larger-scale ones. It is multidisciplinary and focused on real-world objects, and cannot be classed as a type of literary geography, which applies geographical methods to literary objects. Nor, as outlined in this article, is LUS to be confused with other areas of spatial investigation, from geocriticism and Deep Locational Criticism to psychogeography and deep topography. It is more multi-polar and more systematic than these approaches focused on the individual human or the individual city over time tend to be. LUS functions in tandem with, but not as part of, the current mobilities paradigm of the social sciences (recognising the non-static nature of cities). It retains a belief in literature as a primary material which distinguishes it from urban cultural studies and other multimedial methods in city investiga-tion. After outlining the emergence of the new LUS and distinguishing it from these alternative approaches, the article examines another account of the relationship between literature and the city, Franco Moretti’s. For Moretti, city literature is essentially modern and a literature of social (more than physical) mobility. The work of Moretti shares with earlier research for example by Benjamin, or the Chicago School in sociology, a belief that in the words of Bart Keunen ‘an impression of magnitude’ was central in twentieth-century views of city cultures. LUS contrasts with this by emphasising relatively neglected cities, literatures and neighbourhoods, often focusing on the more culturally underdeter-mined areas in which populations live everyday lives and work. Contra Moretti the image of the city varies across literary forms and genres, and its later expressions are not just ‘a hollowing out’ of that found in classics of nineteenth-century realism. Despite later work foundational to literary spatial stud-ies, the 1980s, at least, Moretti seems now surprisingly unconfident about LUS as a discipline. In the late 2010s, emergent disciplines fuel LUS in new ways, among them the radical urban scholarship of Abdou-Maliq Simone and Ananya Roy, and advances in digital humanities research (including those with which Moretti has been involved). Next, the article glances at some foundational figures for LUS from the personal perspective of the author_ Jane Jacobs, Doreen Massey, Jeff Malpas and Eric Prieto. Working in urban studies, critical human geography, place philosophy and spatial literary phenomenology respectively, all humanise actual city environments and challenge simplistic conclusions about ‘the city’. Jacobs’s notion of ‘adventuring in the real world’ could help form a manifesto for LUS. The conclusion of the article emphasises the capaciousness of LUS. This goes beyond individuals of the artist and writer class, and the districts where they have tended to live, opening up textual and experiential equivalents of what Simone calls ‘urban majority’ areas. It may not be at all clear to us what settlements appeared urban in earlier historical eras. LUS enables comparisons between cities of different magnitudes, and the res-toration of personhood to city-dwellers and city areas that have had it stripped from them. © 2019, University of Tartu Press.

In the schema-based categories that enrichment occurs by enhancing the relations between the properties, we have identified two types, including: 1) enriching the properties by defining the hierarchical relations between properties; and, 2) specifying properties' domain and range for data reasoning In addition, the study implements the LOD dataset in a digital humanities platform to demonstrate how instances and entities can be applied in the full texts where the relationship between entities are highlighted in order to bring scholars more semantic details of the texts. © 2019 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

Like the ideas of literature and art, it was one of the main routes through which Koreans developed a socio-political sense when they were forbidden to speak about politics. Starting in the 1920s especially, Koreans used culture to establish intellectual foundations of modernity cultivate the masses' aesthetic senses, and seriously engage with colonial reality. Furthermore, the idea of culture became more complicated in the late 1930s as the colonial government more aggressively employed the cultural idea to propagate a series of wars while mainlining Japan's ascendency in East Asia. Reflecting upon such a conceptual tug of war by different socio-political actors, this article uses text-mining to explore the changing meanings of culture in a 1930s popular magazine. Run by the proponents of culture as a forefront of social movements, Samch'ǒlli (""Three-thousand ri,"" which figuratively refers to Korea) was a monthly magazine that lasted for more than a decade from 1929 to 1941, unlike many short-lived journals under censorship. By examining the frequency of the keywords that composed the theme of culture, and the semantic network of culture's cooccurring words, we diachronically trace the polyphonic meanings of culture in different timeframes. These quantitative and linguistic methods suggest that culture's semantic network drawn from a 1930s periodical was far larger, more diverse in composition, and more influential than explained in previous studies, especially in its interplay with the various socio-political actors in launching collective projects by Korean intellectuals and the colonial government. © 2019 Academia Koreana.

Exon Domesday therefore provides a unique view into the workings of the early Anglo-Normans, providing us with crucial evidence of what they did, how and probably also why.

Since then, provenance and document context have supported the organization of archival knowledge (especially through classification and description procedures). Such relationships were gradually refined over the years and from different experiences between European archives and their classification and ordering systems. Historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. However, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order. Recently, the concept of provenance has been addressed by many other disciplines flaw, library and information science, computer science and visual analytics) and applied to different domains (cloud-based storage, preservation of digital records, digital evidence, digital humanities, e-science, open data, linked data, knowledge organization and indexing.

Navigating the vast tradition of St. Augustine's Sermons: Old instruments and new approaches,2,10.2143/AUG.69.1.3286703,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078806585&doi=10.2143%2fAUG.69.1.3286703&partnerID=40&md5=be7c89c89a4fc958648117b2d134cfc0,"The study of St. Augustine's sermons has developed, over the last three decades, into a dynamic part of the field of patristics. Still, this category of Augustine's oeuvre presents a number of challenges that complicate significant progress for several promising avenues of research into Augustine's preaching. This article first offers a status quaestionis on Augustinian sermon studies since the year 2000. In a second part, the author addresses the issues scholars of Augustine's preaching face: (a) access to a reliable text, (b) the size, dispersal and uneven identification of the corpus, (c) the problem of authentic versus inauthentic, (d) the distance between patristic sermon studies and medieval sermon studies. Finally, the article reviews resources - both existing and still in development - that can help scholars harness the full potential of the rich corpus of sermons attributed to the Bishop of Hippo: (a) the updated critical text of the sermons in Brepols' Library of Latin Texts; (b) existing tools to make sense of the different versions of (pseudo-)Augustine's sermons such as Gryson's Répertoire général des auteurs ecclésiastiques latins de l'Antiquité et du Haut Moyen Âge and Machielsen's Clavis Patristica Pseudepigraphorum Medii Aevi; (c) a recently started project to create a digital network of medieval manuscripts that transmit patristic sermon collections (PASSIM). © 2019 by Peeters Publishers.

Disseminating and hiding information in technical communication courses: The case of patents from the perspective of digital humanities,0,10.7146/hjlcb.v59i1.117041,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078523015&doi=10.7146%2fhjlcb.v59i1.117041&partnerID=40&md5=ef0df9317f3ba0853cf6ff8a5b340767,"Despite their ostensibly aseptic nature, technical texts involve a multifaceted net of institutional, social and pragmatic functions. Patents, in particular, are characterized by a multi-layered rhetorical exercise in which information is provided, and hidden, in light of patent disclosure laws. Drawing on the Cooperative Patent Classification scheme, a corpus of patents related to environmental issues has been compiled. The objective is to investigate the main keywords emerging in the corpus and to analyse their semantic context in this patent type. More specifically, the analysis focuses on the patents' semantic preference and semantic prosody in order to pinpoint and examine the semantic complexities emerging in this genre and to identify the strategies employed (such as the use of linguistic vagueness) in order to provide the necessary information while not disclosing precious data. Patents represent a complex, hybrid and cross-disciplinary genre and a finer understanding of their discursive features may contribute to spreading awareness of the importance that semantics plays within the rhetorical pattern of the text. Therefore, they may be fruitfully employed in Technical Communication courses in order to improved reading comprehension and analytical skills. © 2019 Aarhus Universitet.

It is proposed to distinguish between minor and profound changes and it is affirmed that, for information centers, the fundamental change has been to go from a situation in which information was scarce and the time to look for it abundant, to another in which time to look for information is scarce and information is abundant. This should help redirect the activities of the information centers-following M. Buckland-to stop focusing on the ‘informa-tion-as-an-object’ to concentrate on the ‘information-as-a-process’. Two consolidated movements should help them to guide their future: the Open Science and the Digital Humanities. Some information products that reflect a change in the ways people approach and use information are examined: Museo del Prado’s The Collection, Transcribe Bentham, eBird and Mapa Literari Català. Finally, the author recommends to documentation centers, and specialized and research libraries to guide their services to digitize their heritage collections in an enriched manner, to promote citizen participation, and to create and strengthen communities. © 2019, El Profesional de la Informacion.

It has long been assumed that the concept of a writer's individual or personal style only developed during the early modern period. This paper traces the emergence of style in English writing from the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, performing textual analysis at both the macro and the micro level by using computer software (Voyant; Stylo for R; AntConc) in tandem with traditional close reading. Two major databases were deployed: first, a collection of 279 Middle English digital texts assembled by my research assistant, Imogen Forbes-Macphail, and second, the Middle English Glossarial Database created by Professor Larry Benson, which includes lemmatized texts of Chaucer and Gower's English corpora. The results show that the literary sense of “style” is introduced to the English literary tradition by Chaucer, by way of Petrarch, and then more fully explored by Lydgate, especially in his Fall of Princes. Using stylometry software (Stylo for R by M. Eder), the essay shows in a series of graphs how Chaucer and Gower's styles are distinct from one another, using principal components analysis, cluster analysis, a bootstrap consensus tree, and network analysis; these graphs also show a clear distinction between Chaucer's verse and his prose. I suggest that the difference between Chaucer and Gower is related to these writers' explicit gestures toward the “high style” (Chaucer) and the “plain style” (Gower). The final section of the paper returns to the larger question of style as the word appears in the Forbes-Macphail database, investigating more closely the large spike in usage that appears in the fifteenth century in Lydgate's poetry. By examining his use of personal pronouns and adjectives in conjunction with style, I show that Lydgate pioneered the notion of a writer's personal style, in contradistinction to the rhetorical levels of style (high and low) to which Chaucer and Gower refer. © 2019 The New Chaucer Society",Canterbury Tales,Chaucer,Classical rhetoric,Digital humanities,Fall of Princes,Fifteenth century,Fourteenth century,Gower,Nolan M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no such discourse dedicated to the humanities. Though the humanities appear to be less coherent as a cluster of scholarship than the sciences are, they do share unique characteristics which lead to distinct scholarly communication and research practices. A discourse on making these practices more open and transparent needs to take account of these characteristics. The prevalent scientific perspective in the discourse on more open practices does not do so, which confirms that the discourse's name, open science, indeed excludes the humanities so that talking about open science in the humanities is incoherent. In this paper, I argue that there needs to be a dedicated discourse for more open research and communication practices in the humanities, one that integrates several elements currently fragmented into smaller, unconnected discourses (such as on open access, preprints, or peer review). I discuss three essential elements of open science-preprints, open peer review practices, and liberal open licences-in the realm of the humanities to demonstrate why a dedicated open humanities discourse is required. © 2019 by the author.",Digital humanities,Open humanities,Open science,Peer review,Scholarly communication,,,,Knöchelmann M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increases in computing power and data availability have seen a rise in individual researchers and research groups working on digital scholarship projects in the humanities, arts and social sciences. This article shows how publishers of traditional digital archives have adapted to the increasing prevalence of DH amongst their traditional customers. The success of this adaptation depends entirely on the relationship with the academic community, and Gale has seen a shift from being a provider of products to a partner, trusted to help libraries, scholars and institutions achieve their objectives. As a leading global provider of digital archives, Gale is well placed to review the current state of DH research and teaching, and this article will discuss significant academic events that have brought scholars, librarians and students together, and the lessons learned for institutions around the world looking to expand into DH. Finally, the article looks at how working to understand the common challenges and barriers to DH research and teaching has pushed many archive publishers to re-evaluate traditional archive publishing and enable new and innovative ways to explore the past. © 2019 Chris Houghton and Sarah Ketchley.

So far, narratologists have mostly neglected this progression, which is also known as the digital turn. While the current developments have called our attention to phenomena such as narrative representation across media, the core of narrative theory is still frmly rooted in concepts constructed from the basis of verbal structures and content that can be deemed fxed or unconditional. Tis article argues that we need to extend the scope of narratological inquiry toward the machines of computational media. With the help of conceptual tools borrowed from sofware studies and digital humanities, the article frst identifes three main properties which distinguish the computer from the earlier forms of media: database, procedurality, and reciprocity. It is then shown how these properties challenge some of the core concepts of narrative theory-plot, character, and storyworld-in the analysis of storytelling in computational media. Finally, it is suggested that in the future, narrative theory might put more emphasis on, frstly, authorship as design and, secondly, the performative acts that the designs invite and enable. Te article thus points toward understanding the transformative efect of computational media on the ways in which we see the world and engage with it through the time-honored gif for storytelling.

We analyze a selection of her diverse corpus via term frequency and topic modeling to consider how theme and genre relate in her writings: did Behn express similar themes in the many genres in which she wrote, or did she explore certain themes in certain genres, suggesting that her thematic interests determined the genres in which she wrote and vice versa? Analyzing the relationship between theme and genre in her writing offers insight into whether Behn adhered to the longstanding classical aesthetic concept of decorum: the belief, widespread when Behn wrote, that certain genres require certain themes and vice versa. Our preliminary analysis suggests both that she adhered to decorum and that computational text analysis is useful for studying theme and genre in individual authors.

(Methodology) 21 websites related to digital Dunhuang were accessed, and the subject, size, data type and organization of 8 arts & humanities databases were analyzed. (Finding) The study finds that digital Dunhuang resources are multi-source, multi-format, multi-topical, multi-lingual and multi-cultural. However, the information organization of digital Dunhuang is not yet at the “fine-grained” level. The interoperability and value density of the data is low, and only primary search and word frequency statistics can be used in these databases. (Conclusion) The lack of integration and relevance of resources are principal dimensions that hinder the research of DH, especially for the demand of data mining and analysis.

Other details such as the specific editions digitized, the process of selection, as well as any difficulties met along the way are also provided. At the same time, the activities of our project are also corroborated with similar European projects. In order to address our digitization practice, we also explore a theoretical and methodological framework borrowed by Stanford Literary Lab in terms of conceptualizing what the American researchers call ”the published”, ”the archive” and ”the corpus”. © 2019, Biblioteca Astra Sibiu.

Nevertheless, the geographical dimension of names has hardly been explored until now in the study of anthroponyms. Situated at the intersection of human geography and linguistics, geonomastics, considered as one of the onomastic meta-disciplines, received an important impetus since the introduction of GIS technologies into humanities in the last quarter of the 20th century. This paper presents Cartografía de Apelidos de Galicia (CAG), a free-to-use web application developed at the University of Santiago de Compostela’s Instituto da Lingua Galega that shows the geographical distribution of Galician surnames based on the current Galician population census. The author describes the data sources covered by the app, the structure of the map, its visualizing features and search capacities. The author argues that CAG may be a useful tool for both professional and lay researchers, especially genealogists. Since most of Galician surnames derive from place names, the visualization of their geographical distribution of surnames may be insightful for identifying their origin. Complemented with historical onomastic data, this application may become in the future a valuable source of information about the migration of the population of Galicia. © Sousa Xulio, 2019.",Anthroponymy,Digital humanities,Galicia,Genealogy,Geographic information system,Geonomastics,Surname distribution,,Sousa X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When it comes to visualizing the entangled, complex political geography of early modern societies, however, discrete, contiguous features can be a problematic cartographic choice. One example explored in detail here is the aggressive enserfment of foreign peasants by the Electoral Palatinate in the seventeenth-century Holy Roman Empire. The comparison of an older map of these events with GIS maps based on new data shows how the polygons on the older map exaggerate the extent of Palatine expansion and suggest a continuous distribution of phenomena that were really discontinuous. Indeed, in early modern political geography, the polygon often operates as the cartographic equivalent of problematic concepts such as absolutism and sovereignty. Though point-based maps offer more accurate representations of pre-modern spatial orders, they hinge on the availability of geospatial data. Discussing the potential and limitations of different kinds of spatial data available to early modern historians today, the conclusion calls for a more argument-driven spatial history of early modernity. © 2019 University of Toronto Press.",Cartography,Digital humanities,Early modern history,European history,German history,Historical GIS,Political geography,Polygons,Scholz L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The exercise indicated that articles on fuel cells dominates the research output of one department, and articles on optical coherence tomography dominates the other. Both the corpus of citations and its visualizations in Voyant Tools contribute to librarians' knowledge of their departments and historical spending patterns on specialized resources. This knowledge can be used in professional practice, including collection development and instruction.

Where OAIS compliant digital preservation has been established in recent years, in almost all cases the services aim at the preservation of file-based objects. In the Digital Humanities, research data is often represented in highly structured aggregations, such as Scholarly Digital Editions. Naturally, scholars would like their editions to remain functionally complete as long as possible. Besides standard components like webservers, the presentation typically relies on project specific code interacting with client software like webbrowsers. Especially the latter being subject to rapid change over time invariably makes such environments awkward to maintain once funding has ended. Pragmatic approaches have to be found in order to balance the curation effort and the maintainability of access to research data over time. A sketch of four potential service levels aiming at the long-term availability of research data in the humanities is outlined: (1) Continuous Maintenance, (2) Application Conservation, (3) Application Data Preservation, and (4) Bitstream Preservation. The first being too costly and the last hardly satisfactory in general, we suggest that the implementation of services by an infrastructure provider should concentrate on service levels 2 and 3.

To obtain insights into the community structures and social interactions portrayed in novels, the creation of social networks from novels has gained popularity. Many methods rely on identifying named entities and relations for the construction of these networks, but many of these tools are not specifically created for the literary domain. Furthermore, many of the studies on information extraction from literature typically focus on 19th and early 20th century source material. Because of this, it is unclear if these techniques are as suitable to modern-day literature as they are to those older novels. We present a study in which we evaluate natural language processing tools for the automatic extraction of social networks from novels as well as their network structure. We find that there are no significant differences between old and modern novels but that both are subject to a large amount of variance. Furthermore, we identify several issues that complicate named entity recognition in our set of novels and we present methods to remedy these.

Spatial Humanities 3.0: Qualitative spatial representation and semantic triples as new means of exploration of complex indigenous spatial representations in sixteenth century early colonial Mexican maps,3,10.3366/ijhac.2019.0231,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074110544&doi=10.3366%2fijhac.2019.0231&partnerID=40&md5=cadcfa3b43291b3228faff0b155afdcd,"For some time now, the field of Spatial Humanities has acknowledged the need for a system capable of the spatial exploration of historical and archaeological phenomena beyond Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This idea comes from the need to analyse holistically spatial information, including that which is not geographic (i.e. vague, symbolic and imaginary space). In addition, this need becomes more apparent when dealing with traditions that do not conform to the Modern/European/Cartesian conception of space in which GIS is rooted. This article, explores the use of Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) and Semantic Triples as possible alternative means to model complex and diverse expressions of spatial information, including social and symbolic conceptions in 16th century Mexican maps. Using as case study the map from the region of Atengo-Misquiahuala (Hidalgo) which combine the Mesoamerican and European traditions, we explore how these approaches might open new venues of research, potentially shedding light to long discussed and problematic Mesoamerican spatial categories. Focusing on a contained and partial example, we examine from a theoretical perspective and as a starting point, the possible future implementation of these approaches for historical and archaeological research. © Edinburgh University Press 2019",16th century,Altepetl,Archaeology,Atengo-Misquiahuala,Colonial Latin America,Digital Humanities,GIS,Historical maps,Murrieta-Flores P.,Favila-Vázquez M.,Flores-Morán A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because it is radically interactive and can permit viewers or listeners to modify a work directly by means of their cerebral activity, such art illuminates the role of audience members in shaping that work's meaning; in this way, it literalizes reader-response theory and allows the public to engage even with opaque or alienating pieces. BCI-based art also reframes the significance of the artist's intentions, prompting a reconsideration of the truism that 'the author is dead', both by positing a collective form of authorship and by granting a creator access to her own unconscious impulses. Finally, via the notion that it may be possible to transfer unfiltered ideas between brains, BCI-inspired artworks provide a new perspective on art as mediation. Although artists have traditionally been praised for seeming to grant direct access to their emotions, one could argue that artistry happens in the act of concretizing and externalizing one's ideas - that is, in the mediated translation of thought rather than in thought itself. The essay concludes by discussing the implications of this theoretical framework for (among other fields) the digital humanities. © Edinburgh University Press 2019",Aesthetic theory,Authors,BCI,Brain-computer interface,Intention,Mediation,Reader-response,Reception,Alfano V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using an example drawn from the vast archives of postwar interviews with Holocaust survivors, it draws on approaches developed in Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR) to explore how two key spatial aspects of survivor's narratives - their uncertain wartime trajectories and the slippage in scales as these are retold - can be represented. Spatial information in narratives tends to not provide the exact coordinates necessary to store the information in geospatial databases. Instead, narratives rely much more on often less precise qualitative spatial relations such as 'near', 'next to', 'at the corner of' without precise geometric interpretations. Given that relational databases are ill-equipped to store this kind of relational spatial knowledge from natural language sources, the article argues for a need for digital humanists to return to first principles and reconsider database design. Descriptive triple-based graph representations, which have been devised to accommodate this kind of highly irregular, semi-structured relational knowledge, have the potential to work with, rather than against, the grain of the narrative sources that underlie the work of much of the digital humanities. © Edinburgh University Press 2019",Graph databases,Holocaust survivors' narratives,Knowledge graphs,Qualitative Spatial Representation (QSR),Spatial information,,,,Cole T.,Hahmann T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nowadays, however, this view is beginning to change. An increased interest in these remarkable documentary texts has been encouraged and facilitated primarily by multiple initiatives that intend to bring papal or curial documents from regional repositories closer to researchers in the form of digital data. In a very short time, international, national, or institutional projects providing data bases and/or collections of digital images of medieval sources have become indispensable research tools. Transylvania, in particular, once a province of the Kingdom of Hungary and thus part of the medieval Latin world, benefits significantly from this wave of computer supported and controlled endeavours (both old and more recent). The intention of my presentation is to discuss how medieval studies from Transylvania (traditionally a multilingual and international research environment) employ this new technological compound, examine the limitations of each distinctive project, and finally consider possible steps for further expansion and improvement. © 2019 Firenze University Press",Curial sources,Databases,Digitization,Middle Ages,Romania,Transylvania,,,Dincă A.C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, researchers and archivists have experimented with innovative interfaces for access to writer’s archives that emerge from individual research cultures and practices. Simultaneously, archives such as the British Archive for Contemporary Writing (BACW) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) are beginning to collect the work of authors who work in inventive digital ways. This article will therefore explore the following question: how might archivists, authors and researchers profitably collaborate to explore the nature of creativity in the born-digital archive, so that both digital preservation and digital scholarship take place? In doing so, the authors look to the complementary fields of genetic criticism and digital humanities to inform the development of archival tools as ‘hermeneutical instruments’. They will explore how such instruments might allow us to read horizontally across archival strata, building on an ‘esthetic of the possible’ to develop a ‘jouer avec les fonds’, supported through collaboration between researchers, archivists and writers. Finally, the authors consider how this approach challenges archival practices, and propose forms of collaboration that might address both archival practice and emerging forms of scholarship. © 2019, © 2019 Paul Gooding, Jos Smith and Justine Mann.",archiving,creativity,Literary archives,,,,,,Gooding P.,Smith J.,Mann J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Google form of searching has shaped our view of digital possibilities and profoundly affects our search and research habits. Yet in early pioneering work which led to the digital revolution of the 1990s, search was not a major consideration and there was a stronger emphasis on linking files. With the rise of very large born-digital resources such as e-mail archives, Wikileak dumps and web archives, the limitations of Google-type searching are becoming more evident. This paper reviews the limitations of search in exploring born-digital archives and starts to sketch out possible approaches to an alternative. It is suggested that a return to digital roots, by renewing the interest of pioneers such as Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson in the linking of files, may provide one approach to born-digital archives. © 2019, © 2019 Jane Winters and Andrew Prescott.",born-digital,digital humanities,email archives,search,Web archives,,,,Winters J.,Prescott A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The database contains nearly 420 000 tokens in XML-tagged files. The texts are linguistically diverse: the parallel use of old and new spelling systems, dialects, and the background of the parish clerk bring about a lot of language variation. There are also differences in the orthographic choices made during the manual insertion of the texts. For the purpose of linguistic analysis and tagging, automatic morphological analysis and named entity recognition was tested using EstNLTK libraries. A closer examination of the output suggested that it is necessary to use both text normalization and tool adaption for improving the quality of automatic analyses. This would result in tools, which would perform better at analyzing similar texts and which could, therefore, be applied in the automatic analysis crowd-sourced material. Making the communal court minute books accessible and searchable by supplying linguistic and topical information creates a rich digital resource which is subject of interest for many disciplines. © 2019 Estonian Association Applied Linguists.

Despite the existence of profound scientific publications devoted to this problem in Russia and abroad, it still needs to be developed. The article emphasizes the urgency of its research in historical, anthropological and humanities perspective, because personal experience of those who survived after forced labor in Nazi Germany, must be stored in collective memory and comprehended by subsequent generations. Methods and materials. Digital Humanities based on the method of oral history allows to solve this problem. The article presents two options of practical implementation of the issue: the online archive of the interview Forced Labor in 1939-1945. Memories and history and related online platform Learning based on interviews. Forced labor in 1939-1945. The archive includes about 600 narrative biographical interviews with victims of Nazi forced labor in 26 countries. The site accompanying the archive is now available in English, German, Russian and Czech. The second project is based on six specially selected interviews from the archive. Broad source base and nationally-oriented concept of forced labor in Nazi Germany, presented on the platform, create the historical context necessary for using this resource primarily in the secondary educational system of the Russian Federation. Analysis and results. The article shows the possibility of using archive-interviews in science and education, and emphasizes that traditional and new methods of historical research can complement each other. The article emphasizes that biographical films created on the basis of interviews can make the memory of forced labor in Nazi Germany, first of all, of “eastern workers” and Soviet prisoners of war more visible in Russian cultural memory.

In parallel, the recent surge of novel interdisciplinary approaches in science requires scholars to acquire competencies in new fields for which they may lack the necessary vocabulary to formulate adequate queries. This problem, together with the issue of information overload, poses new challenges in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and visualization design that call for a rapid response from the scientific community. In this respect, we report on a novel visualization scheme that enables the exploration of research paper collections via the analysis of semantic proximity relationships found in author-assigned keywords. Our proposal replaces traditional string queries with a bag-of-words (BoW) extracted from a user-generated auxiliary corpus that captures the intentionality of the research. Continuing along the lines established by other authors in the fields of literature-based discovery (LBD), NLP, and visual analytics (VA), we combine novel advances in the fields of NLP with visual network analysis techniques to offer scholars a perspective of the target corpus that better fits their research interests. To highlight the advantages of our proposal, we conduct two experiments employing a collection of visualization research papers and an auxiliary cross-domain BoW. Here, we showcase how our visualization can be used to maximize the effectiveness of a browsing session by enhancing the language acquisition task, which allows for effectively extracting knowledge that is in line with the users' previous expectations. © 2013 IEEE.",Academic corpora,digital humanities,document exploration,human-computer interaction,knowledge elicitation,latent semantic analysis,literature-based discovery,visualization,Benito-Santos A.,Sanchez R.T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both Joyce and Tammet use mapping as means to understand human emotions in their texts. As critics have noted, at the precise point we want to observe the meeting of Stephen and Bloom, the style of “Ithaca”—which is obsessed with mapping its characters’ exact movements in night-time Dublin, and crowded with lists, catalogues, and arcane scientific data—prevents us from seeing anything of their humanity. Similarly, in one of his essays, Tammet tries to map out the movements of his mother in order to understand her mind and emotions, which are unavailable to him as a person with autism. While Joyce himself was not likely on the spectrum (as a recent critic has suggested), this reading connects recent theories of mindblindness and reading “Ithaca” as performance that re-creates a mind on the spectrum. This article concludes with a few thoughts on fears of “distant reading” in the digital humanities, which in the fashion of “Ithaca” also prefers maps, lists, and graphs toward a more traditional humanistic inquiry into literary texts. © Common Ground Research Networks, Richard Dragan, All Rights Reserved.",Asperger’s,Autism,Daniel Tammet,James Joyce,Mark Haddon,Ulysses,,,Dragan R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, we propose in this article a representation model of historical event. The particularity of our model is to represent simultaneously multiple versions of the same event from different sources. Furthermore, we discuss our model as a field of expertise for new research and investigation problems. © 2019, International University of Sarajevo.",Class diagram,Event,History,Knowledge modelling,Multi-version representation,,,,Zendaoui F.,Hidouci W.K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has vastly altered the way we locate ourselves in the world at large. In the context of the proliferation of interactive online mapping sites of various degrees of complexity that are available in real time, and the parallel emergence in the academy of the Digital Humanities as a formal field of inquiry, this article discusses an embryonic digital mapping project located in Johannesburg, South Africa. Provisionally titled JoziQuest, this project aims to unwrap the intricacies of space and memory in a city that remains structured by legacies of apartheid and exclusionary urban planning. The project aims to disturb conventional approaches to urban research by offering a nuanced scholarly and creative engagement with a series of sites and spaces related to the almost forgotten legacy left by the architect Hermann Kallenbach who was a close friend of the global icon of passive resistance and Indian independence Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. © Common Ground Research Networks, Jill Weintroub, All Rights Reserved.",Digital Humanities,Hermann Kallenbach,Johannesburg,Mapping,Walter Benjamin,,,,Weintroub J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scholars and information professionals working in the fields of research libraries, archives, and information play a crucial role as users and providers in cultivating the kind of world-class research that today increasingly relies on the use of these digital research infrastructures. Therefore, their continuous professional development is essential for them to be able to reap the benefits available from the ever-changing field of eHumanities and eHeritage research infrastructures, a mission that is at the heart of the Training team of the Horizon 2020 funded project PARTHENOS (“Pooling Activities, Resources and Tools for Heritage e-Research, Optimization and Synergies”). This paper describes the “PARTHENOS eHumanities and eHeritage Webinar Series.” These five live and interactive seminars delivered via the internet represent an introductory training programme that focuses on the professional development and capacity building needs and requirements of (digital) humanities and cultural heritage scholars, as well as of information specialists who work for digital humanities and digital heritage infrastructures. Using the PARTHENOS Webinar Series as a case study of the development and delivery of research infrastructure-focussed professional development, the paper outlines the intellectual, educational, and practical context in which the PARTHE-NOS Webinar Series was conceived, the syllabus used for the initial run of the series, and the analysis of the data collection exercises conducted after the first five webinars, especially the feedback collected from both the trainees and the trainers (online survey and open questions study), and it discusses possibilities for improvement. In the conclusion, the paper places the insights from the PARTHENOS webinars in the context of the potential of webinars for research infrastructure training. It argues that in order to reap their full potential for research infrastructures as training instruments as well as instruments to gain insights in user requirements, new developments, and for community building, further theoretical grounding, professionalization, and on-going analysis of their effectiveness is needed. © 2019, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

Two-Stage Deep Learning Approach to the Classification of Fine-Art Paintings,49,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907986,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064842425&doi=10.1109%2fACCESS.2019.2907986&partnerID=40&md5=064a28386da7156b3cd8c9aacdc8979d,"Due to the digitization of fine art collections, pictures of fine art objects stored at museums and art galleries became widely available to the public. It created a demand for efficient software tools that would allow rapid retrieval and semantic categorization of art. This paper introduces a new, two-stage image classification approach aiming to improve the style classification accuracy. At the first stage, the proposed approach divides the input image into five patches and applies a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to train and classify each patch individually. At the second stage, the outcomes from the individual five patches are fused in the decision-making module, which applies a shallow neural network trained on the probability vectors given by the first-stage classifier. While the first stage categorizes the input image based on the individual patches, the second stage infers the final decision label categorizing the artistic style of the analyzed input image. The key factor in improving the accuracy compared to the baseline techniques is the fact that the second stage is trained independently on the first stage using probability vectors instead of images. This way, the second stage is effectively trained to compensate for the potential mistakes made during the first stage. The proposed method was tested using six different pre-trained CNNs (AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, and Inceptionv3) as the first-stage classifiers, and a shallow neural network as a second-stage classifier. The experiments conducted using three standard art classification datasets indicated that the proposed method presents a significant improvement over the existing baseline techniques. © 2013 IEEE.",digital humanities,Fine art style recognition,machine learning,multi-stage classification,painting classification,transfer learning,,,Sandoval C.,Pirogova E.,Lech M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the reprinting of particular texts in a range of different locations can be regarded as an old and well-acknowledged practice in the press, a systematic examination was not possible until the digitization of these historical documents. This primary research material derives from the digitized OCR corpus of newspapers and periodicals published by the National Library of Finland. In the COMHIS project, we have developed a text-mining software, based on NCBI BLAST, which effectively recognizes and enables the location of textual repetitions. We have found approximately 13.8 million clusters of text reuse. As well as an introduction to the methods and uses of BLAST, the article will also explore the results gained through these and what they reveal about the nature of the circulation of information in the Finnish press during this period.

Within this context, this article aims to demonstrate that the combined use of photogrammetry and light analysis gives us a useful tool for resolving issues arising in the historiography of architecture, particular for the Baroque period. In this case, the study focuses exclusively on the use of natural light in religious buildings, without paying particular attention to the use of candles for the time being. To do so, the article focuses on the specific case of the convent church of San Jacinto (Seville), presenting the results obtained by combining the different techniques: measurement-based surveying, photogrammetry and computer light analysis. The results include varying levels of detail that enable each of them to be evaluated. This data has been used to try to provide a response to a long-standing scientific issue: providing a preliminary specification of what has been defined as a cave-shaped space by determining the levels of light in each part of the building. More specifically, an architectural model of the use of natural light has been achieved which, compared to other buildings studied previously, enables new data to be gathered with respect to the illumination of religious buildings in the Middle Ages in Andalusia, which can also be extrapolated to other areas on the Iberian Peninsula and abroad. © FUOC, 2019.",Art history,Baroque architecture,Digital humanities,Light analysis,Photogrammetry,,,,Luengo P.,Luengo J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, I am interested in the appropriation of search technologies by artists in the registration, selection, organization, configuration, classification and management of information practices, which are reconfiguring the poetics of archiving and collecting. The presence of ICTs in art reconfigures the ontology of archiving as they emerge within the hybrid framework of humans and artificial substances. This is what I call the digital archon: a form of subjectivation that operates anchored to algorithmic discernment, perceiving stimuli as indications and responding to them by disseminating data. Lastly, based on what I call a swarming archive, I analyse the logic of grouping objects or data characterized by the accelerated growth of digital information, the lack of congregation and the absence of similarity, which questions the modern idea of archiving as documentary or institutional content, as well as its dependence on principles such as Respect des fonds. © 2019, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

The speed of progress and technological development and the shifts in the inherent paradigms and methodologies require us to re-engineer the software so that it works effectively and enables is to use the information that it gives us, In 1994, at the headquarters of the SIELAE, a relational database was created to store bibliographic information on accounts of events with technologies that were cutting edge at time, but which are now outdated (despite the software being updated and several adaptations already having been made). Meanwhile, the advances in knowledge in the field of research, facilitated by the work on the database, have led to certain changes in the data model and the need to manage an unexpectedly large volume of information. For all these reasons (technological advances, modifications of the data model and the huge volume of information), two decades later, we have addressed the need to re-engineer the CBDRS database, as the software suffered from performance issues (the long time required to wait after a search) and users now expect greater usability and functionalitiesfrom digital catalogues. Therefore, in this article, we present the progress made in the re-engineering of the CBDRS database, which is being constructed as a data provider using the OAI-PMH protocol in the Dublin Core format, thereby enabling its integration with meta-search engines that apply this protocol, such as ARACNE (the Spanish Digital Humanities and Arts Network), which also aggregates other collections, such as Hispana (access portal to national digital heritage and aggregator) and Europeana (access portal to European digital heritage). The updates and modifications applied to the CBDRS have made it a far more powerful database with the capacity to store a large amount of information, which can be retrieved by the user in no time at all by applying multiple search criteria. In addition, it will enable search results to be exported to other formats and sent automatically. One of the great new developments of the CBDRS database is that a GIS system has been added, which enables us to view the information resulting from map consultations. Lastly, in is a multi-device application, with an interface that automatically adapts to different devices (smartphones, tablets, computers, etc.), thereby ensuring the full accessibility of the content. © 2019, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

A pop music composition is normally made of two parts—the tune and the lyrics. Here we use a digital humanities and data science approach to examine how lyrics changed between the 1950’s and the more recent years, and apply quantitative analysis to measure these changes. To identify possible differences, we analyzed the sentiments expressed in the songs of the Billboard Hot 100, which reflects the preferences of popular music listeners and fans in each year. Automatic sentiment analysis of 6,150 Billboard 100 songs covering all the years from 1951 through 2016 shows clear and statistically significant changes in sentiments expressed through the lyrics of popular music, generally towards a more negative tone. The results show that anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and conscientiousness have increased significantly, while joy, confidence, and openness expressed in pop song lyrics have declined. © 2018 by the International Association for the Study of Popular Music, U.S. Branch (IASPM-US).

How to tell ancient signs apart?

In this context, this article assesses three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures along with three learning approaches to train them for hieroglyph classification, which is a very challenging task due to the limited availability of segmented ancient Maya glyphs. More precisely, the first approach, the baseline, relies on pretrained networks as feature extractor. The second one investigates a transfer learning method by fine-tuning a pretrained network for our glyph classification task. The third approach considers directly training networks from scratch with our glyph data. The merits of three different network architectures are compared: A generic sequential model (i.e., LeNet), a sketch-specific sequential network (i.e., Sketch-a-Net), and the recent Residual Networks. The sketch-specific model trained from scratch outperforms other models and training strategies. Even for a challenging 150-class classification task, this model achieves 70.3% average accuracy and proves itself promising in case of a small amount of cultural heritage shape data. Furthermore, we visualize the discriminative parts of glyphs with the recent Grad-CAM method, and demonstrate that the discriminative parts learned by the model agree, in general, with the expert annotation of the glyph specificity (diagnostic features). Finally, as a step toward systematic evaluation of these visualizations, we conduct a perceptual crowdsourcing study. Specifically, we analyze the interpretability of the representations from Sketch-a-Net and ResNet-50. Overall, our article takes two important steps toward providing tools to scholars in the digital humanities: Increased performance for automation and improved interpretability of algorithms. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",convolutional neural networks,crowdsourcing,Maya glyphs,shape recognition,transfer learning,,,,Can G.,Odobez J.-M.,Gatica-Perez D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given a large corpus of images and a query image, an interesting further step is to retrieve the set of original images whose content is present in the query image, as well as the detailed sequences of transformations that yield the query image, given the original images. This is a problem that recently has received the name of image provenance analysis. In these times of public media manipulation (e.g., fake news and meme sharing), obtaining the history of image transformations is relevant for fact checking and authorship verification, among many other applications. This paper presents an end-to-end processing pipeline for image provenance analysis which works at real-world scale. It employs a cutting-edge image filtering solution that is custom-tailored for the problem at hand, as well as novel techniques for obtaining the provenance graph that expresses how the images, as nodes, are ancestrally connected. A comprehensive set of experiments for each stage of the pipeline is provided, comparing the proposed solution with the state-of-the-art results, employing previously published data sets.

Towards a manifesto for a critical digital humanities: critiquing the extractive capitalism of digital society,6,10.1057/s41599-018-0075-y,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048175954&doi=10.1057%2fs41599-018-0075-y&partnerID=40&md5=c4127fb177667ff954be1d3692eb132e,"This article proceeds in two distinct parts. The first section engages with a deliberately small number of popular texts written by discriminating and interrogative consumers and producers of digital culture and society. While these may be dismissed as journalistic texts and sources by those of a more focused academic intent, here these texts are used because they are the connection between academic engagement and wider public readership. As such, they frame what can be termed the critical public engagement with digital capitalism. These texts are read in tandem with my thesis of immaterial capitalism and Marazzi’s’ The Violence of Financial Capitalism. The paper then concludes with what can be described as the ‘manifesto turn’ by raising some questions for a renewed engagement with digital society, to be undertaken from what is termed, an emergent critical digital humanities, as the site of critique and resistance. This is an exercise in what can be labelled Mongrel methodology and ideology, a neo-logism deliberately provocative in intent to signal a post-academic approach, chosen over such traditional descriptors as mixed-methods or assemblage and the like. As such, it may draw on Marxist thought but is not Marxist in ideology or final intent; it is critical of capitalism but acknowledges our on-going existence and possibilities within it; it is written by an academic seeking to act as intermediary between academic and non-academic readings and responses. It is a deliberate act of provocation as a manifesto call for change. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,,,,,,,Grimshaw M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its widespread use stands in sharp contrast to the paucity of its theoretical development, which is limited to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's 1975 seminal book Kafka. Pour une littérature mineure. We claim that a comparative history of minor literatures in European languages- A nonexistent project so far-requires three preliminary steps, namely, conceptual clarification, cross-pollination between comparative literary history and the digital humanities, and a bibliometric analysis of the minor-literature constellation. First, conceptual clarification is needed to show, on the one hand, how Deleuze and Guattari's arguments on minor literatures significantly differ from those of what they posit as their source (Kafka's discussion on kleine Literaturen) and, on the other hand, the existence of alternative genealogies. Second, by adhering to a Braudelian definition of comparative history, the massive data needed for addressing the production and reception of (minor) literatures in specific social and cultural contexts would immensely benefit from recourse to digital tools. Third, and as an example of approaching conceptual clarification with digital tools, a quantitative study of the minor-literature constellation must be performed using a key tool of international scholarship (the MLA International Bibliography). In the current paper, we may only provide an introductory survey of these three fields and, therefore, the results are tentative and further research is needed. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",bibliometrics,big data,comparative literary history,digital humanities,minor literature,,,,Domínguez C.,Di Rosario G.,Ciastellardi M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finding a place for genealogy and family history in the digital humanities,3,10.1108/DLP-11-2017-0044,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053681669&doi=10.1108%2fDLP-11-2017-0044&partnerID=40&md5=157de7569115583c593cb4325a21214f,"Purpose: Despite its growing popularity, there is a noticeable absence of references to the inclusion of genealogy and family history studies within the field of digital humanities. New forms of inclusiveness, particularly in production-coding and cultural analysis, closely align genealogy and family history with the core tenants practiced among humanities computing and digital humanities. This paper aims to prove that genealogy as family history should be formally recognized within this cohort, as it can serve as a valuable and innovative partner for advocacy and technological advancement of the field. Design/methodology/approach: By examining the literature, genealogy will be defined according to its use in the digital humanities, as well as its use in family history studies. The core tenants of humanities computing and digital humanities will be identified and compared against the research methodology and technological tools used in genealogy and family history research. The comparison will determine how closely the fields align, and if genealogy defined as family history should be used, and included within the field of digital humanities. Findings: The progression of genealogy and family history from production to cultural analysis corresponds with the transition of production and coding (influenced by humanities computing) to the inclusion of experimental cultural research adopted by the digital humanities. Genealogy’s use of technological tools, such as databases, text encoding, data-text mining, graphic information systems and DNA mapping, demonstrates the use of coding and production. Cultural analysis through demographic study, crowdsourcing and establishing cultural connections illustrates new methods of scholarship, and connects coding and cultural criticism, serving as a bridge between digital humanities and the humanities at large. As genealogy continues to create new partnerships of a collaborative nature, it can, and will, continue to contribute to new areas of study within the field. As these practices continue to converge with the digital humanities, genealogy should be recognized as a partner and member in the digital humanities cohort. Originality/value: Despite its growing popularity, there is a noticeable absence of references to the inclusion of genealogy and family history studies within the field of the digital humanities. The term genealogy resonates differently within the digital humanities, primarily articulating the history of the field over the study and research of family lineage. This study seeks to demonstrate how genealogy and family history can fit within the digital humanities, providing a new perspective that has not yet been articulated in the scholarly literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cultural analysis humanities,Genetic ancestry,Historical societies,Humanities computing,Intersectionality,Libraries,,,Hoeve C.D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The experiences of the authors in collaborating with DH scholars and community organizations is discussed with references to the literature. The paper suggests how research libraries can use existing expertise and infrastructure to support the development of digital cultural heritage collections and DH research. Findings: Developing working collaborations with DH researchers and community organizations is a productive way to engage in impactful cultural heritage digital projects. It can aid resource allocation decisions to support active research, strategic goals, community needs and the development and preservation of unique, locally relevant collections. Libraries do not need to radically transform themselves to do this work, they have established strengths that can be effective in meeting the challenges of DH research.

As a solution to the problems of world literature by Moretti, "" distant reading"" symbolizes the paradigm revolution of reading objects, reading subjects and reading methods with its "" second-hand reading"", large-scaled reading, collaborative reading and computational criticism, thus contributing to the digital humanistic transformation of literary criticism.

GIS can effectively handle spatial entities and offer sophisticated analysis and modelling functions to deal with space. Only a small fraction of the literature in Geographic Information Science—or GIScience in short—has advanced the development of place, addressing entities with an ambiguous boundary and relying more on the human or social attributes of a location rather than on crisp geographic boundaries. While the GIScience developments support the establishment of the digital humanities, GISs were never designed to handle subjective or vague data. We, an international group of authors, juxtapose place and space in English language and in several other languages and discuss potential consequences for Geoinformatics and GIScience. In particular, we address the question of whether linguistic and cultural settings play a role in the perception of place. We report on some facts revealed by this multi-language and multi-cultural dialogue, and what particular aspects of place we were able to discern regarding the few languages addressed. © 2018 by the authors.",Digital humanities,GIScience,Place-based GIS,Sense of place,Spatial turn,,,,Blaschke T.,Merschdorf H.,Cabrera-Barona P.,Gao S.,Papadakis E.,Kovacs-Györi A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Owing to controversial developments in the political sphere, public awareness of the role of big data in our lives has grown. Anxieties about â € microtargeting' and â € dataveillance' inflect our increasingly troubled relationship with computational culture, particularly as the commercialization of the Internet and its fragmentation into proprietary platforms mean that algorithmic and machine-learning processes are hidden away from scrutiny in â € black box' systems. Books by Nick Srnicek and Richard J. Lane discuss the turn towards big data and platforms, detailing the ways in which humanities scholars might engage with such transformations. A second strand of digital culture looks at the relationship between humanity and machines, with the material turn encouraging more sustained examination of â € digital bodies'. This is the name of the collection edited by Susan Broadhurst and Sara Price, who bring together essays from a range of artists, performers, fashion designers, and sociologists. Looking at the augmentation of humanity by the digital, Andrew Pilsch aims to rehabilitate the transhumanist movement in scholarly circles by relocating it within a longer tradition of utopian evolutionary futurism that can be traced back to the early twentieth century. By contrast, N. Katherine Hayles turns to cognitive processes, arguing that recent discoveries in neuroscience regarding nonconscious cognition can realign our understanding of the relationship between humanity and machine. The final part of this chapter looks at recent monographs by David Berry and Anders Fagerjord and by James Smithies that propose new inflections of the digital humanities in response to the challenges outlined in the foregoing discussion. © The English Association (2018) All rights reserved.

Framing psychology as a discipline (1950 -1999): A large-scale term co-occurrence analysis of scientific literature in psychology,34,10.1037/hop0000067,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056349473&doi=10.1037%2fhop0000067&partnerID=40&md5=8dfbba8cb4c0b65429ebe88595cf6bc8,"This study investigated the structure of psychological literature as represented by a corpus of 676,393 articles in the period from 1950 to 1999. The corpus was extracted from 1,269 journals indexed by PsycINFO. The data in our analysis consisted of the relevant terms mined from the titles and abstracts of all of the articles in the corpus. Based on the co-occurrences of these terms, we developed a series of chronological visualizations using a bibliometric software tool called VOSviewer. These visualizations produced a stable structure through the 5 decades under analysis, and this structure was analyzed as a data-mined proxy for the disciplinary formation of scientific psychology in the second part of the 20th century. Considering the stable structure uncovered by our term co-occurrence analysis and its visualization, we discuss it in the context of Lee Cronbach's ""Two Disciplines of Scientific Psychology"" (1957) and conventional history of 20th-century psychology's disciplinary formation and history of methods. Our aim was to provide a comprehensive digital humanities perspective on the large-scale structural development of research in English-language psychology from 1950 to 1999. © 2018 American Psychological Association.",Digital humanities,Disciplinary formation,Methodology in psychology,Term co-occurrence visualizations,Two disciplines of scientific psychology,,,,Flis I.,van Eck N.J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This widespread transformation is rooted in a growing interest in showing data together with synthesis and argument, the importance afforded to public engagement, and the proliferation of digital platforms that enable creative presentations of scholarly work. In this context, we discuss our experience producing an excavation report that attempts to integrate several forms of scholarly and public-facing communication on a digital platform, and aims to engage audiences at multiple levels, while simultaneously facilitating data reuse and laying out the authors’ current interpretations. We consider the benefits and challenges of producing work in this way through the example of producing the Gabii Project’s first volume, A Mid-Republican House from Gabii, developed through a collaboration between the Gabii Project team and the University of Michigan Press.

In this interview, Helland and Wang exchanged views on such issues as Ibsen and Shakespeare, Ibsen and German thoughts, Ibsen and Power, Ibsen and digital humanities research. Wang argues that Ibsen's theatrical achievement, rooted in Western intellectual and cultural tradition ranging from ancient Greek tragedy, Shakespeare's plays, the Nordic myth and legend to the Christian tradition and German thoughts, is largely contributed by his concerns about social issues of his time in Europe. In his response, Helland adds that Ibsen's global popularity is also attributed to his artistic achievements and the commercial value of his works. Helland points out that the topics such as Ibsen and Shakespeare, and Ibsen and German thought are also worth exploring. Furthermore, he claims that the digital humanities and inter-disciplinary studies will bring new inspiration and energy to contemporary Ibsen studies. © Copyright by Foreign Literature Studies.

Together, they attempted to launch Thought News, a “philosophical newspaper” that never saw the light of day. But both before and after that failed project, Ford never stopped developing a vision for the future of the news. Reading Ford is a jumping-off point for experimentations that raise original methodological questions in the field of media history and theoretical developments that speak to contemporary media problems. In that regard, our paper focuses on the methodological experiment undertaken to explore Ford’s work: the creation of an automated Twitter account, a “bot” that uses text-mining techniques to automatically tweet excerpts from his writings. The paper describes the concrete steps of that remediation: from the delineation of Ford’s written work to the gathering and digitization of the material and its transformation into tweetable soundbites. We argue that this combination of close and automated reading offers heuristic elements of surprise to guide the historical inquiry. As the tweets echo the specific genre of today’s “future-of-the-news” thinkers, they also constitute an attempt to explore the relationship between “old” and “new” media. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital archive,digital humanities,future of news,journalism history,remediation,social bot,,,De Maeyer J.,Trudel D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While a growing number of media and communication studies projects have applied these techniques to corpuses of born-digital journalism, using the same tools to analyse large-scale collections of historical newspapers requires us to overcome additional technological and methodological challenges. Our discussion is framed around a historical case study examining references to the United States in the 19th Century British Library Newspaper Archive. The article begins by highlighting the problems that researchers of both digital and historical journalism face when attempting to deal with an enormous body of evidence. Next, it argues that Topic Modelling offers one potential solution to these problems by providing a way to “distant read” the archive. The remainder of the article is divided into five experiments that demonstrate how Topic Modelling can be applied to a series of research questions, each of which is applicable to other projects that might make use of newspaper archives. As well as demonstrating the investigative potential of topic modelling, the article also highlights the practical and technological barriers that currently undermine its effectiveness, particularly when it is applied to archives of historical material. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Anglo-American relations,digital humanities,distant reading,journalism history,nineteenth century,topic modelling,transatlantic,,Van Galen Q.,Nicholson B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, its evolution has been witnessed foremost in the growth of funded DH projects and through the willingness of scholars from diverse backgrounds to not only work in DH research, but also as 'digital humanists'. One crucial component to DH research is that of spatial enquiry, the expansion of which has rapidly evolved from a small component often found buried in research objectives, to the research aim of a growing number of projects. Spatial humanities, while still a relatively new interdisciplinary field, is exhibiting continued advancement and focus from the academic community; however, working with digital data is rarely a straightforward pursuit, even for the most accomplished scholar. Primarily access to appropriate and reliable (spatial) datasets, the keystone of spatial humanities research, the sharing and openness of spatial methods, tools and data (SMTD), and education in the former, all remain a challenge. © Edinburgh University Press 2018.",,,,,,,,,Porter C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing on a customised corpus of writing about the English Lake District, we model the application of a multiscalar approach known as geographical text analysis (GTA), which combines aspects of close reading and distant reading, and, in doing so, introduces a new method for literary research. Here, we focus on historical descriptions of the Lake District's soundscape to demonstrate both how perceptions of sound changed over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and how multi-scalar methods can uniquely uncover such historical-literary shifts. Sound, we argue, offers a particularly useful focus since it allows us to draw fruitful parallels between our methods and those applied by the writers we study. In this way, this article advocates for digital humanities scholarship that advances our disciplines in conversation with appropriate historical modes. © Edinburgh University Press 2018.",Close reading,Distant reading,Lake district,Multiscalar analysis,Sound,Spatial humanities,,,Taylor J.E.,Gregory I.N.,Donaldson C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dianetics was the brainchild of science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, and became the foundation for scientology toward the end of the decade. Dianetics was marketed as a “scientific” method for mental improvement—a robust alternative to conventional psychiatry—and was strongly debated in science fiction (sf) magazines. This article follows the trajectory of this cultural phenomenon from 1949 to 1999 as it appeared in this form of popular culture. A proximal reading method was applied to analyze 4,431 magazines, and identified 389 references to dianetics and scientology. References were found in advertising, reader letters, stories, feature articles, and editorials. Significant fluctuations in the prominence and perception of dianetics became clearly visible in the source material across a broad spectrum of content. Negative criticism was present from the outset, and based on logical and scientific arguments. This was countered by obfuscation, or attacks on the authors of these critiques.

This is particularly so with ‘edge cases’, projects which look to collate, curate, and create thematically consistent critical insights on topics of relevance to the Arts and Humanities, using unfamiliar forms. This brief essay explores a selection of digital projects that might be classified as edge cases, interacting with relevant stakeholders through short surveys designed to determine why digital apparatus were favored.

Humanists are well aware that cultural knowledge, aesthetic value and copyright/ownership are not monolithic, yet digital humanities work often expects the replication of narrow ideas of such. Drawing on the growing body of scholarship that situates the digital humanities in a broad global context, this paper points to areas of tension within the field and posits ways that digital humanities practitioners might resist such moves to homogenize the field. Working within the framework of border studies, the paper considers how working across national barriers might further digital humanities work. Finally, ideas of ownership and/or copyright are unique to country of origin and, as such, deserve careful attention.

Where the progress is slower is in our moves towards openness and inclusivity, and this is to some extent hampered by a lack of linguistic diversity.

This essay focuses on arguably the most controversial: the use of statistical methodologies to analyze literary texts. Often aimed at the “distant reading” practices of Franco Moretti, the pros and cons of these methods have been widely debated among literary scholars, but with little reference to their historical roots. Historical accounts of DH have instead focused on technological developments, citing the massive, computerized concordance of the works of Thomas Aquinas, envisioned in 1949 by Father Roberto Busa and realized by IBM over the next 20 years, as the moment DH was born. Such accounts, as useful as they are, neglect important connections between the computational methodologies of DH and the emergence of modern statistical methodology during the nineteenth century. The advantage of seeing DH as part of the history of statistics is that it helps us understand and evaluate statistically based DH methodologies in their own terms and not simply as methodologies associated with particular neoliberal institutions in the present. This essay argues that understanding the history of statistics as well as examining current practice helps address the criticisms leveled at computational methodologies and the question of compatibility with traditional humanistic methodologies such as close reading. It begins with a brief history of the emergence of modern statistics in the nineteenth century and the impact on Victorian literature and popular culture and then examines recent DH scholarship that utilizes statistical methodologies to analyze Victorian texts. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,,,Babb G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existing work on science mapping provides multiple tools to visualize research trends in domain on macro-level, and work from the digital humanities have proposed text visualization of documents, topics, sentences, and words on micro-level. However, existing micro-level text visualizations are not tailored for scientific paper corpus, and cannot support meso-level scientific reading, which aligns a set of core papers based on their research progress, before drilling down to individual papers. To bridge this gap, the present paper proposes LitStoryTeller+, an interactive system under a unified framework that can support both meso-level and micro-level scientific paper visual storytelling. More specifically, we use entities (concepts and terminologies) as basic visual elements, and visualize entity storylines across papers and within a paper borrowing metaphors from screen play. To identify entities and entity communities, named entity recognition and community detection are performed. We also employ a variety of text mining methods such as extractive text summarization and comparative sentence classification to provide rich textual information supplementary to our visualizations. We also propose a top-down story-reading strategy that best takes advantage of our system. Two comprehensive hypothetical walkthroughs to explore documents from the computer science domain and history domain with our system demonstrate the effectiveness of our story-reading strategy and the usefulness of LitStoryTeller+. © 2018, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Close-reading,Comparative sentence classification,Extractive summarization,Narrative storylines,Scientific paper visualization,Visual storytelling,,,Ping Q.,Chen C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Communication practices of micromorphological researchers have not evolved significantly or, at least, at the same rate as archaeology as a whole, which has recently experienced an explosion of technological applications related to documentation. This paper aims to explore and illustrate a new methodological proposal for thin section digitalization and for the presentation of micromorphological data in scientific articles. We started from a premise: micromorphology should be a discipline based on images, since they provide the essential data of micromorphological observation and inference. The proposal combines existing tools and techniques, as well as those from other disciplines, to increase the standard quality of images used in scientific publications and produce dynamic and contextualized illustrations of research results in micromorphology. The final goal of the workflow is to provide keys and tools that allow researchers, as producers of information, to present their data in a more effective, contextualized and informative way as article enrichments or linked illustrations in their papers. To illustrate the procedure, we use two samples from different archaeological contexts: the Palaeolithic site of Roc de Marsal (France) and the Roman city of Baelo Claudia (Spain). The benefits of this proposal are multiple: a) access and objectivity to raw research data, b) improvement in the interaction among micromorphologists, c) spreading of the informative potential of micromorphology to the research community, and, finally, d) making the reader an active participant in the information. Although there are different eligible ways of image scanning and data sharing, the combination of gigapixel thin sections and article enrichments define a step forward in communicating research results and sharing raw data, an opportunity that should be fostered and not be missed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Archaeological soil micromorphology,Article enrichments,Digital humanities,Geoarchaeology,Open data,Thin section,,,Gutiérrez-Rodríguez M.,Toscano M.,Goldberg P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With growing academic interest in the study of the evolution of digital writing on the one hand and the rise of disinformation on the other, the problem of identifying the relationship between texts with similar content is becoming more important. Traditional vector space representations of texts have made progress in solving this problem when it is cast as a reconstruction task that organizes related texts into a tree expressing relationships - this is dubbed text phylogeny in the information forensics literature. However, as new text representation methods have been successfully applied to many other text analysis problems, it is worth investigating if they too are used in text phylogeny tree reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the use of word embeddings as a text representation method, with the aim of trying to improve the accuracy of reconstructed phylogeny trees for real-world data and compare it with other widely used text representation methods. We evaluate the performance on established benchmarks for this task: a synthetic data set and data collected from Wikipedia. We also apply our framework to a new data set of fan fiction based on some famous fairy tales. Experimental results show that word embeddings are competitive with other feature sets for the published benchmarks, and are highly effective for creative writing. © 2013 IEEE.",Digital humanities,Forensics,Machine learning,Natural language processing,Text phylogeny,Word embeddings,,,Shen B.,Forstall C.W.,Rocha A.D.R.,Scheirer W.J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The essay proposes that scholarly engagement with travel writing can benefit from the use of “distant reading” in two regards. First, by visualising data that has previously only been available in textual formats and in alphabetical order, the project could make apparent patterns across time and with regard to travel destinations. Second, the project is an attempt to automate the “reading” of titles in a bibliography of travel writing as a test case for adding a comparative component to examining nineteenth-century travel writing across diverse national publishing practices.

Historical collaborative geocoding,9,10.3390/ijgi7070262,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063064148&doi=10.3390%2fijgi7070262&partnerID=40&md5=c82a15ac96ce77d4d0a7dee9e4dd3016,"The latest developments in the field of digital humanities have increasingly enabled the construction of large data sets which can be easily accessed and used. These data sets often contain indirect spatial information, such as historical addresses. Historical geocoding is the process of transforming indirect spatial information into direct locations which can be placed on a map, thus allowing for spatial analysis and cross-referencing. There are many geocoders that work efficiently for current addresses. However, these do not tackle temporal information, and usually follow a strict hierarchy (country, city, street, house number, etc.) which is difficult — if not impossible — to use with historical data. Historical data is filled with uncertainty (pertaining to temporal, textual, and positional accuracy, as well as to the reliability of historical sources) which can neither be ignored nor entirely resolved. Our open source, open data, and extensible solution for geocoding is based on extracting a large number of simple gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects, from historical maps. Geocoding a historical address becomes the process of finding one or several geohistorical objects in the gazetteers which best match the historical address searched by the user. The matching criteria are customisable, weighted, and include several dimensions (fuzzy string, fuzzy temporal, level of detail, positional accuracy). Since our goal is to facilitate historical work, we also put forward web-based user interfaces which help geocode (one address or batch mode) and display results over current or historical maps. Geocoded results can then be checked and edited collaboratively (no source is modified). The system was tested on the city of Paris, France, for the 19th and 20th centuries. It showed high response rates and worked quickly enough to be used interactively. © 2018 by the authors.",Citizen science,Collaborative,Crowd-sourced,Database,Digital humanities,Geocoding,Geohistorical objects,GIS,Cura R.,Dumenieu B.,Abadie N.,Costes B.,Perret J.,Gribaudi M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It focuses on the two periodicals Kontinent and Sintaksis (founded in 1974 and 1978, respectively)-not merely through the lens of individual contributions or statements by editors, such as Vladimir Maximov, Maria Rozanova, and Andrey Sinyavsky. Applying new methodological approaches from the emerging field of periodical studies and digital humanities, this article argues that through these journals, the third wave creates in the West a cultural environment that resembles the Soviet one on a structural level. The disagreement between individual emigre periodicals, like the two discussed here, is not simply an ideological conflict-be it between Soviet socialism and dissidence or along one of the cleavage lines that divided the emigre community. The model of the “literary‐artistic and sociopolitical journal,” now transplanted to the West in the form of Maximov’s Kontinent, comes to functionally mimic the Soviet mass publication, absorbing and masking dissent without the need for active censorship. Established successfully in the mid‐1970s, this model prompts a number of subversive tactics expressed in Rozanova’s editorial work. Relying on a cultural repertoire rooted in Soviet experience, Sintaksis becomes a constitutive element of the “Soviet Union on the Seine,” a cultural space that understands itself in opposition to and ideologically divorced from the Soviet Union, without, however, becoming fully independent from it. © 2018 The Russian Review.",,,,,,,,,Gleissner P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the project's goal being to achieve the sum of human knowledge, there are strong content imbalances across the language editions. In order to quantify and investigate these imbalances, we study the impact of cultural context in 40 language editions. To this purpose, we developed a computational method to identify articles that can be related to the editors' cultural context associated to each Wikipedia language edition. We employed a combination of strategies taking into account geolocated articles, specific keywords and categories, as well as links between articles. We verified the method's quality with manual assessment and found an average precision of 0.92 and an average recall of 0.95. The results show that about a quarter of each Wikipedia language edition is dedicated to represent the corresponding cultural context. Although a considerable part of this content was created during the first years of the project, its creation is sustained over time. An analysis of cross-language coverage of this content shows that most of it is unique in its original language, and reveals special links between cultural contexts; at the same time, it highlights gaps where the encyclopedia could extend its content. The approach and findings presented in this study can help to foster participation and inter-cultural enrichment of Wikipedias.

Web-based Multimedia Mapping for Spatial Analysis and Visualization in the Digital Humanities: a Case Study of Language Documentation in Nepal,2,10.1007/s41651-017-0012-4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083260129&doi=10.1007%2fs41651-017-0012-4&partnerID=40&md5=3871dcf2e98eab5272a23ae965d71767,"There has been a growing interest in utilizing geographic information systems (GIS) in the digital humanities and social sciences (DH). GIS-based DH projects usually emphasize spatial analysis and cartographic capability (e.g., displaying the locations of people, events, or movements), however, GIS alone cannot easily integrate multimedia components (e.g., descriptive text, photographs, digital audio, and video) of DH projects. Multimedia mapping provides a unique approach to integrating geospatial information in digital map format and multimedia information, which is useful for DH integration into spatial analysis and visualization. As cartographic mapping and GIS evolve from a traditional desktop platform to the World Wide Web, it is of significance to design and develop a Web-based multimedia mapping approach that could carry out spatial analysis and incorporate multimedia components, which is greatly beneficial to the DH applications. Our objectives of the language documentation research project in Nepal were to (1) use geo-tagging equipment to collect audio and visual recordings of three types of socio-linguistic data: language attitudes and practices interviews, free-form narratives, and elicited vocabulary and grammatical paradigm sets, from representative speakers of the four endangered languages in twenty-six Manang villages; (2) design and develop a Web-based, interactive multimedia atlas that can display data points corresponding to the speakers, links to the three types of data gathered in multimedia format, provides friendly user interface for the manipulation and spatial analysis of all the data. It is anticipated that the Web-based, interactive, and multimedia language atlas can bring all local and international stakeholders, such as the speech communities, linguists, local government agencies, and the public, together to raise awareness of language structures, language practices, language endangerment, and opportunities for preservation, all through this easy-to-use means that enhance the geo-spatial representation in engaging visual and sensory (multimedia) formats.

Within this framework of critical inquiry, this paper discusses the mechanisms of canon-formation in the context of the web as the new laboratory of cultural production. It is argued that the main dynamics observed can be elucidated under the form of a triad: hypercanonization, socialdecanonization, and transcanonization. These three processes operate simultaneously interlaced and unfold in dialectical tension between the rise of the new (practices, actors, values, ideas), and the maintenance of the old (those structures that already exist). This paper delves into the paths through which such interlace dynamics and tension might reshape the principles by which canonicity develops, as well as poses open questions about the challenges facing us, which should be discussed in further studies and approaches to the problem. © 2018 by the author.

It begins with a brief critical discussion of the representational approaches that are the common form of information visualizations and suggests that the less familiar non-representational approach could be used to augment these existing visualizations by supporting interpretative work that is closer to the practice of humanistic hermeneutic traditions. Representational display, based on large-scale processing, surrogates, and conventional visualizations, and non-representational modeling at the level of the individual interpretative act operate at very different scales to support intellectual work. In a representational approach, data precede display. Display is a surrogate produced according to automated protocols and algorithms. These cannot be altered or intervened except through rewriting their code, and the display, though interpretative and subject to interpretation, cannot be used as a means by which interpretation is actually modeled. While all visualizations express a model, they do not all provide a modeling environment. In the non-representational approach proposed here, graphical input serves as a primary means of interpretative work. More significantly, a graphical environment that supports direct modeling of interpretation allows traditional humanistic approaches, close reading, and marking of texts, documents, artifacts, or images, to be integrated with computationally produced visualizations.

This article contributes a fresh understanding by examining the material development of HumlabX, a research laboratory for digital humanities at Umea° University, Sweden. Specifically, we approach the empirical case as a timeline of research funding, projects, events, and deliverables to examine how the research laboratory as an organizational and material space developed and evolved in relation to new technology investments. Based on our analysis, we argue that while digital research infrastructures can, indeed, stimulate innovation in and around research, aimed to produce new knowledge, digital technologies carry social and material implications that affect organizational processes. We show that while knowledge production processes at HumlabX were highly influenced by the infrastructural legacy of the past, they indeed directed scholars toward innovation. By discussing these implications in detail, we move beyond the debate of humanities qua digital, and demonstrate the need for scholars of digital humanities to engage in the development of policies for digital research infrastructures. Using a Swedish case study, we argue that research laboratories for the digital humanities must be scrutinized and should be fully exposed as socio-material organizations that develop, and should develop, over time. In particular, we stress the need to ensure that digital humanities laboratories are sustainable and open for redevelopment. © The Author 2017.",,,,,,,,,Foka A.,Misharina A.,Arvidsson V.,Gelfgren S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The images were registered into the British Museum’s permanent collection and treated as objects in their own right, not just digital reproductions of objects. As a wholly born-digital collection, this led to several opportunities and challenges for documentation, dissemination, and digital humanities outputs, including a fully searchable database, social media, website, 3D modelling and printing, and virtual reality, to name a few. Increasingly, digital technologies are being used in standard archaeological research and practice. From digital photography to larger 3D modelling/scanning, the volume of data being created by archaeologists is increasing exponentially, as is the potential for these outputs to change research and community engagement. But with the massive amounts of data being created, are researchers documenting and disseminating their data to their full potential? Here, traditional museum practices of cataloguing, storing, and public engagement can inform archaeological practice to use these data collections for both scholarly research and community engagement. Through a critically reflective description of the work and challenges of the project, this paper argues that there are significant benefits to be gained by engaging digital rock art projects with established museum thinking and practice. © 2018, The Author(s).",Community engagement,Digital technology,Museum practice,Rock art,,,,,Anderson H.,Galvin E.,de Torres Rodriguez J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this paper is to employ the DID3 projects as a case study to explore the following research question: what roles do librarians and archivists take on in data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and international DH projects? Design/methodology/approach: Participation was secured from 53 persons representing eleven projects. The study was conducted in the naturalistic paradigm. It is a qualitative case study involving snowball sampling, semi-structured interviews, and grounded analysis. Findings: Librarians or archivists were involved officially in 3 of the 11 projects (27.3 percent). Perhaps more importantly, information professionals played vital unofficial roles in these projects, namely as consultants and liaisons and also as technical support. Information and library science (ILS) expertise helped DID3 researchers with issues such as visualization, rights management, and user testing. DID3 participants also suggested ways in which librarians and archivists might further support DH projects, concentrating on three key areas: curation, outreach, and ILS education. Finally, six directions for future research are suggested.

MAVCOR publishes a born-digital, open-access double-blind peer-reviewed journal, MAVCOR Journal. It also features a born-digital exhibition space, the Material Objects Archive. In at least two ways, MAVCOR is deliberately interstitial, invested in the connective spaces between both disciplines and technologies. First, the Center emerged from a desire to promote interdisciplinary conversation among scholars of religion, art history, anthropology, and others engaged with our subjects of inquiry. We have aimed to accomplish this goal by shaping a forum for conversation and an archive for mutual use. Second, MAVCOR engages the need to form a space for peer-reviewed content online in a manner that emphasizes the mutually beneficial relationship of print and digital modes of inquiry. In this work, MAVCOR’s overarching commitment is to promote innovative, substantively researched, thoughtfully constructed scholarship, with robust interdisciplinarity as a fundamental element of form and content. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",born digital,Collaborative,digital humanities,material religion,peer review,,,,Floyd E.C.,Promey S.M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It applies tools associated with the digital humanities to the study of Protestant evangelicalism in order to ask what digital research methods can offer the study of religion. Beginning with the development of a social media computer program called a Twitter bot designed to mimic evangelical ministers on twitter, the article considers how digital scholarship allows the work scholars produce to mirror more closely the religious worlds they study. Next, the article analyzes the results of the program using text analysis software. In documenting trends in the bot's output, the article highlights how digital research methods can help answer long-standing questions in the field as well as potentially ask new ones. It concludes, The article, then, is both an exploration of contemporary religious cultures and a consideration of new media methods for analyzing them. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Digital humanities,evangelicalism,social media,Twitter,,,,,Cantwell C.D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this essay we discuss two courses we taught in conjunction with the Religious Soundmap Project of the Global Midwest, a collaborative digital humanities project that we co-directed from 2014 to 2016. Engaging students as contributors to a collaborative digital research project helped them to appreciate some of the key practical, theoretical, and ethical challenges that we face as scholars of religion. In particular, our work together brought to the fore critical questions about definition, classification, and representation. Even more, because they knew their work would be accessible to broader audiences outside the classroom, potentially including the very communities whom they were studying, students were able to perceive the stakes of these questions in ways we had not previously experienced. Incorporating digital tools enabled our students to see themselves as scholars of religion. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Collaboration,critical study of religion,digital humanities,engaged pedagogy,religious sounds,teaching religious studies,,,DeRogatis A.,Weiner I.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Innovative management strategies for building and sustaining a digital initiatives department with limited resources,2,10.1108/DLP-08-2017-0029,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038866716&doi=10.1108%2fDLP-08-2017-0029&partnerID=40&md5=2f8a570431165be1a7b424a01e8be62c,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to offer and explore innovative strategies for building and sustaining digital initiatives at information organizations. Although the examples provided are based on case studies at an academic library, the practices are rooted in project management principles and therefore applicable to all library types, museums, archives and other information organizations. The innovative strategies on staffing and funding will be particularly useful to organizations faced with monetary and staffing shortages and highlights collaborative management practices. Design/methodology/approach: Concept of strategic and collaborative management practices led by an experienced project manager cross-trained in management, technical and soft skills enables the successful development and sustainability of digital initiatives. A cross-trained librarian’s management practices of leading the Digital Scholarship Initiatives at a particular university will be examined as a case study and aided with literature supporting the need for digital initiatives leaders to have training beyond the credentials of librarian, curator, archivist or historian in the technologically savvy twenty-first century ecology of information centers. Findings: The innovative strategies implemented in the case study yielded increases in the number of hours of digital lab usage, digital projects developed, seminars or workshops presented, attendance of library hosted events, number of programs implemented and awareness on campus, all with limited staff and funding. The variety and level of production and marketing is instrumental to the growth and sustainability of digital initiatives. Practical implications: The innovative strategies emphasized in this paper use the concept of borrowed or shared time to start staffing needs and is particularly helpful to organizations that do not have a strong line of dedicated staffing or funding to begin building digital initiatives. Offers small ways to start immediately while setting the stage to plan for big ideas for the future. Originality/value: This paper suggests a credentialed information expert, such as a librarian, archivist or curator, that is, also cross-trained in project management and technology is the key to not only successfully leading digital initiatives but is instrumental for its sustainability and the marketing, growth and future of digital initiatives. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities,Digital initiatives,Digital scholarship,Innovation,Library development,Library management,Project management,,Miller A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She became both a symbol of his loss, and a living monument to his legacy—an ambassador between the living and the dead. Responsible not only for preserving his memory on earth, a widow was also expected to pray on behalf of her husband’s soul, to work to rescue him from the torments of Purgatory through her dutiful appeals. Widows were at once asked to pray quietly alone, and tasked with work central to society: the salvation of souls after death. This dual identity—sometimes isolated, yet of fundamental importance—makes the widow an opportune subject for students of early modern conceptions of the relationship between religion and gender. In this essay, I look at widows in Lucrezia Tornabuoni’s Judith, Hebrew Widow and Antonia Tanini Pulci’s The Destruction of Saul and the Lament of David. Taught side-by-side, these texts provide students with multiple, interconnected ports of entry into the early modern world, encouraging an investigation of how the two women writers worked to place widows at the center of their respective stories, rather than relegated to the margins. © 2018 by the authors.",Antonia Tanini Pulci,Digital humanities,Lucrezia Tornabuoni,Medici family,Quattrocento Florence,Sacre rappresentazioni,Widowhood,Women writers,Wainwright A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The successes and limitations of this computational methodology shed light on its further uses in sociological research and has answered the question: What can topic modeling demonstrate about the men's rights activism movement's prescriptive masculinity? This methodology not only proved that it could replicate the results of a previous study, but also delivered insights into an increasingly political focus within TRP, and deeper perspectives into the concepts identified within the movement. © 2018 by the authors.",Digital humanities,Machine learning,Masculinities,Men's rights activism,Online communities,,,,Mountford J.B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scholars from disciplines such as literature and history are collaborating with scientists from disciplines such as statistics and computer science. Moreover, these interdisciplinary teams often reach beyond campuses to companies as well as local, national, and international public and nonprofit institutions. Surprisingly, the computational research that began in the humanities in the 1950s did not develop an important presence within mainstream scholarship until half a century later. The DH experiences thus far reflect the complexity of both human expression and research collaborations across diverse fields and sectors. Learning from past successes and failures will help meet today's data analytic challenges and prepare us for opportunities in statistical applications ranging from literary studies and cybersecurity to business intelligence and health indicators.

In this perspective, I present a visualization of toponyms co-occurrences in the literary journal Die Fackel (""The Torch""), published by the satirist and language critic Karl Kraus in Vienna from 1899 until 1936. The distant reading experiments consist in drawing lines on maps in order to uncover patterns which are not easily retraceable during close reading. I discuss their status in the context of a digital humanities study. This is not an authoritative cartography of the work but rather an indirect depiction of the viewpoint of Kraus and his contemporaries.

The traditional approach by using editions of compiled facsimiles to find a similar handwriting is very time-consuming, as a lot of data is required to increase the plausibility of the results. This is where Nomina Sacra comes into play: Like a finding tool, it connects more facsimiles via database structures while focussing only on selected widespread lexemes, namely Nomina sacra (Ludwig Traube), to keep the amount of data manageable. In a next step, the matching facsimiles could be seeked out and used for closer analysis. Unlike well-funded computer scientifical projects dealing with digital image processing, Nomina Sacra is a low price and low tech tool. It is following purposely the path of an evolutionary integration of technical elements beyond digital paradigms in the field of historical auxiliary sciences for the good of human skills acquisition instead of its substitution by predictive text technology in the field of Digital Humanities. As long as more ambitious projects are heading for their (by all means) promising but distant goals, the Nomina Sacra database provides a ready-to-use tool that could be helpful not least for educational purposes. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

Consequently, the personel teaching of these aspects is sharply reduced, especially in Germany, and the teaching of these skills nearly disappeared in most universities. The change from 'auxiliary' to 'fundamental' science, which began about thirty years ago, will not help, only the awareness that purely hypothetical and theoretical history is a very uncertain house of cards if not verified by patient factual research. Marc Bloch already was conscient of the fact that history is more than erudition, but also that without it, it is irrevelant. To survive in this post-truth era of political and also of scientific contempt of the very presuppositions of history as science and of truth as an universal value, the teaching of the auxiliary sciences, old ones and new (as digital humanities, which ask for more and not less traditional skills) must be reintegrated into the normal curriculum and, until this is done, offered by special centers in- and outside the universities. Personalities being capable not only to organize research, but also to reach the general public and to embody the joys of discoveries close to the sources are essential to build bridges. There is hope though: students ask for a knowledge which makes them experts, while heraldry, sigillography, codicology show an unexpected flowering, and diplomatics renew completely old questions. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

The second section explores how digital archives of both digitized materials and borndigital ones have intersected with the origin and consolidation of the Digital Humanities in the US, underscoring the way these intersections have fostered the development of suitable methodologies and vocabularies to examine digitized and born-digital cultural products. The third section explores a handful of Mexican projects developed in the last few years, and proposes that Mexican digital literary scholarship is unique in its emphasis on decolonial perspectives, community building and recovery, education and training, and new creative expressions.

It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics. Design/methodology/approach: The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis. Findings: There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science. Research limitations/implications: This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain. Originality/value: The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",CiteSpace,Digital cultural heritage,Digital history,Digital humanities,Digital literary,Humanities computing,Library and information services,Visualization analysis,Wang Q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such treasure cataloged in The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) Libraries is a collection of over 33,000 Sanborn™ Fire Insurance Maps. Originally kept safe in metal drawers, the library has embarked on a journey to digitize this abundance of information, combine it with other media such as photographs, and make it accessible through a web interface. Inspired by these efforts, we accessed this information and took it to the next level. Using state of the art 3D modeling and immersive technologies, we created a historic 3D model and immersive experiences of Penn State, exemplarily for the 1922 campus.

However, there are still few digital theatre and performance archives and many of them are not yet equipped to realize the potential of digital documentation; they have been slow to adopt standards for data reusability, findability and interoperability. A field that provides an example is language documentation, even though this comparison might not readily strike performance scholars as immediately apparent. While there are a number of important differences, this article suggests that some aspects of language documentation might be relevant to the documentation of performance. Language documentation is still an incipient field but it has a more stable set of tools at its disposal. This article was written as a collaboration between a language documentation practitioner and a theatre scholar. It is our contention that both performance and language documentation can borrow from each other's technical and conceptual toolkits, a possibility that has been largely ignored to date in both disciplines. We hypothesize the reasons behind this omission and offer some suggestions of how a conversation across these disciplines might begin, by focusing on a case study where a language documentation perspective improves the functionality of a theatre documentation project. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Digital archives,digital humanities,language documentation,metadata,,,,,Escobar Varela M.,Lee N.H.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other hand, “refugee selfies,” the images refugees themselves are taking, avoid co-optation into such narratives.

Alternative Toronto is rooted in twin frustrations: with approaches to Canadian history that ignore its radical edges as well as its feminist, anti-racist, Indigenous and LGBTQ+ struggles; and with U.S.- and U.K.-centric radical histories that fail to consider movements beyond their borders. To counter these tendencies, the project adopts–and adapts–the spirit of Britain’s History Workshop movement, which created community-based spaces for collaborative historical inquiry that were open to scholars, independent historians and community members alike. By doing so, it asks how digital tools and a dialogic approach to copyright can be used to democratize the archive as both a site and a process, in keeping with the non-hierarchical principles of its subject. It also hopes that by remediating the audiocassettes, videotapes and print materials that were lost in the transition from analogue to digital formats, the site will encourage contributors and visitors to engage in the radical mediation of Toronto’s recent past. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,,,,,,,Radovac L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These conferences sought to expand the knowledge about the planning history of the Paris Region as well as to develop international comparative studies. This initiative was a reaction to the lack of historical depth in the discourse of the main actors of the Grand Paris planning process. It also sought to assemble for the first time and complete the historical research on the overall planning of the greater region, connecting it with research on other metropolitan planning histories.

Theorists have not given patterns the attention they deserve. Therefore it is far from clear what patterns are and to what purpose scholars may use them. This paper presents eight propositions on patterns which hold true for patterns found ‘by hand’ and patterns found ‘by computation’. One such is that a pattern is discernible in behaviour when we subject it to the intentional stance, as the philosopher Daniel Dennett argues. Here behaviour is part of an intentional system. This paper’s argument is that the patterns found ‘by computation’ too are part of an intentional system. To substantiate this claim this paper discusses two important examples of detecting computational patterns in the domain of the humanities. © 2017 The Author(s).

If modernist studies is to thrive in a digital age, we must attend to questions of style and UX (user experience) design. To give design its due is a feminist act. It involves considering the audience’s needs and interests, recognizing them as partners in the scholarly endeavor, and embracing style and aesthetics as crucial to the work of digital humanities. Feminist design also entails rethinking the processes of generating and disseminating knowledge and reinventing our scholarly methods in order to break down hierarchies, encourage open exchanges of expertise, and reflect the diversity of human creative production. In Part II, we discuss Mina Loy: Navigating the Avant-Garde, an experiment in modernist digital humanities that aims to move questions of design from the periphery to the center of scholarly attention (http://mina-loy.com/).

The project aligns with what Kim Gallon has referred to as a “technology of recovery,” which is one of the core principles bridging African American literary studies and the digital humanities. The project uses Scalar’s visualization and tagging structures to explore stylistic, thematic, and social relationships among a small group of writers, as well as to explore the conversations these writers were having with established writers and editors. Several key themes have begun to emerge as the project has developed. The first of these is the confrontation with American racism, which impacted African American communities intensely in the 1910s; and these poets document the emergence racial violence and the response to that violence. Second, these poets show how the role of African American motherhood was evolving in the early years of the twentieth-century, in part because of the stresses of raising children in a racist society. Third, the black Church became strongly connected to the movement for social justice at this time; and several, if not most, of the writers in this archive explored Christian themes in their anti-racist writing. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",christianity,digital archive,feminism,Harlem Renaissance,modenrism,motherhood,New Negro,Race,Singh A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a film editor and researcher, I am interested in revealing and visually expressing cinematic rhythm. I am following hereby Karen Pearlman’s idea stating that “the functions of rhythm are to create cycles of tension and release and to synchronize the spectator’s physical, emotional, and cognitive fluctuations with the rhythms of the film.” (Pearlman 2009: 61) These are the rhythmic trajectories that constitute a sensuous, kinesthetic knowledge about a film. In my work, I am interested in visualizing these trajectories, adding a layer of a visual ‘close reading’ to the given film sequence while preserving the original sequence. My research project is situated at the intersection of information visualization, digital humanities, and artistic practice and follows a mixed method approach. The essay consists of two visualizations and a written part that is meant to highlight the research questions, to situate the research within the different fields and to provide insight into the creative process of developing the first two visualizations. The first étude uses a sequence from the short documentary Wagah (Supriyo Sen, 2009, Germany/India), edited by the author, showing the bizarre choreography of the flag-lowering ceremony on the Indian-Pakistani border. The video essay examines how rhythm can be built out of different elements such as sound and movement, colour, graphical structures, cuts, etc. The rhythmical structure has been deconstructed and formalized to reach an abstract notation and to represent a movement. The second étude focuses on the rhythm of gestures using a scene from the film A Woman Under the Influence (John Cassavetes, 1974, USA), edited by David Armstrong, showing the main lead, Gena Rowlands, wildly gesticulating during a fight with her husband in the film, Peter Falk. This is a ‘close-up’ of the gestures that are defining and leading the conversation. Using a similar visualization method, gestures are transposed into colourful meandering lines. © 2018, Apparatus.

Feminist scholars are currently engaged in changing information design and data visualizations. However, as feminists seek to create new ontologies of gender, they face difficulties posed not only by current encoding standards, but by changing concepts of gender. Can ontologies ever capture the complex, multi-layered, dynamic nature of gender identities? This question is especially challenging when dealing with modernist works that represent gender and sexual identities at the very moment of their emergence as such. Our work on a digital edition and archive of Man into Woman (1933), the life narrative of Lili Elbe, one of the first persons to undergo gender affirmation surgery, has brought home to us both the pressing need for feminist interventions in data models and gender ontologies, and the difficulties if not impossibility of any adequate ontology of gender. In answer to the question posed above, we respond, only if we revise our concept of what the end result is: the linked data network visualization must capture a temporal process and not a snapshot of a static moment or even a series of moments. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",data visualization,Gender,linked data,ontology,TEI/XML,transgender,,,Caughie P.L.,Datskou E.,Parker R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When Urania embraces cleo. Nonchalantly about history or eine einführung in die streichholzforschung,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079545196&partnerID=40&md5=59cc0661c3b8d939edd72cce48fd52cf,"From the marriage of Zeus with Mnemosyne, the nine classical muses came from. Among them, Urania (the muse of astronomy) and Cleo (the patron of history) were in a peculiar relationship at a time when the inspiration played a fundamental role for the intellectual work which was considered an art. The very name of Cleo (the “Glorious”) points to one of the concepts for the mission of history to tell about bygone events and to celebrate someone’s deeds. This makes it a subjective occupation, the results of which depend on the skills of the narrator and his attitude toward the target object, which is why issues, events and personalities receive conflicting assessments. The acts of Cleo and Urania in antiquity were often mixed up, and this creates confusion in clarifying the relationships of individual characters. But the interaction between the two sisters gave birth to the fruit of a knowledge combining the scent of the universal infinity with poetry united in the essence of history. The very name (from the Greek ἱστορία – study, knowledge acquired through research) shows that the main task of a historian in his work is to study and verify the information, and only then comes the narrative, dressed in an appropriate form. Sources are of a various nature, so the individual disciplines involved with their analysis are also numerous. Thus, from the embrace of Urania with Cleo, the fundamental disciplines of history were born without which it could not claim to be a science. 1681 is considered to be the birth date of the auxiliary sciences of history. In this year Jean Mabillion’s profound work set the beginning of scientific diplomatics and palaeography. Subsequently, other works on the two disciplines were published; genealogy, heraldry, sigillography and historical chronology began to establish themselves as separate scientific and practical fields; over time a number of other specific areas in the study of source material occurred which gave rise to new and new special historical sciences. Then the nineteenth century came, which is perhaps the “classical century” of history, when having mastered the critical approach to the past and its sources, seekers of retrospective knowledge attempted to establish the norms in the historical process, and positivism was about to glorify history as a relatively objective science. However, the disappointment in the results, reinforced by the stress accompanying the ruination during the two world wars, contributed to the staggering at the other extreme and overestimation of the subjective moment in the past. Today historical science, as we have known it until recently, still attracts the attention of the general public, but has long since ceased to be a “fortress of high knowledge”. The walls are dilapidated, the princess is abducted, the treasure of the shattered vault is dragged in an unknown direction and laity barbarians are wandering along the narrow labyrinths of the castle, announcing their own “truth” about past times. History has ceded more and more of its territories to science disciplines “sprouted” from it, satisfying itself with the role of a “side dish” and “appetizer” to the main dishes of politology, sociology, culturology, ethnology, anthropology. Still the hope remains that Foucault’s pendulum may swing back and the combination of the “subjectivist” experience with that of the verifiable “exact” sciences may produce a new vision of history not only as a fundamental interpretative science but also as an applicable in practice (experimental) science. The article undertakes a brief attempt to trace the development and critical reflection of the studies of sources in Bulgaria focusing on the achievements of The Auxiliary Historical Disciplines Department at the Unified Centre of History at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the successor of which is today’s Department of Auxiliary Historical Sciences and Informatics. The author expresses concern about the tendency of uncontrolled “swarming” of the science, the result of narrow specialization, but he also conveys optimism about the achievement of various qualitatively new forms of collaboration between history and “exact sciences” with the help of digital humanities. © 2018, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

Utilizing the Modernist Podcast as a case study, this paper reframes the debate along aural lines by surveying the potential of podcasting for modernist studies. Thinking through the podcast as an alternate model of scholarly production, the paper examines the multifaceted feminist potentiality of podcasting as both a method of knowledge sharing and a pedagogical tool.

In essence and method, religious history is like history of religion(s). In German and Dutch, one can speak of Religionsgeschichte or religiegeschiedenis/godsdienst-geschiedenis. Different terms are in use in English and French, reflecting the different traditions in the disciplines of theology and history. History of religion(s)/histoire des religions is commonly associated with comparative studies of (non-Christian) religions, while religious history/histoire religieuse developed as a specialisation within general history (mostly concerned with Christianity and therefore close to what is known as church history or ecclesiastical history). While understanding religious history as general history with a focus on the religious factor in cultural, social, and political realities, various research traditions should be converged and integrated by means of conceptual exchange, cross-disciplinary approaches, and linked scholarly networks. Given the interest in global dimensions and long-term developments, computer-assisted research of digitalised sources is recommended for doing religious history today. © 2018 Brill Academic Publishers.

However, such kind of projects usually entail a greater level of time, effort, and intellectual input from the public. In such case, what motivates volunteers remains little studied and poorly understood. To better understand volunteers' motivations and how they may benefit from their participation, we conducted interviews on volunteers in the Transcribe Sheng project, a crowdsourcing project in digital humanities domain in China. Grounded theory is employed to investigate the motivations from the interview data. The preliminary findings show that volunteers are motivated by a complex framework involving external factors, cognitive value, emotional perception, and task driven factors. Based on the qualitative analysis, this study proposes a preliminary theoretical framework to understand volunteers' motivations, which may also yield practical implications on digital humanity practices.

Currently in its third year of operation, the Radical Inclusion project has been utilizing consumer grade technology to capture, preserve, and disseminate unique cultural and historical experiences in immersive VR & 360-degree video format. Presented as a case study, detailed examples include workflows associated with the capture, post-processing, and dissemination of content associated with large-scale artwork installations: from in-depth exchanges and documentation of projects in the process of construction, to experiential vignettes from the Burning Man event that occurs in the Black Rock Desert. Archival collections are shared more broadly to “radically include” individuals and to preserve the experience for the future so that people can study and better understand thoughts and inspirations of the artists and fellow participants. Associated detail includes specific workflows developed and software; ethical considerations and practice surrounding the capture, sharing, and sustainability of the collection; and the potentially novel hybrid use of use of Islandora and Kaltura as web platform for distribution.

The Greek Key is a collaborative, scalable, multidisciplinary project that has the potential to engage librarians in participatory strategies such as crowdsourcing (or “Citizen Science”). The Greek Key tools for visualizing textual data have the potential to: reveal previously undetected patterns in books and collections; make connections among different works; help users bring new information to bear on interpretation; demonstrate the significance of findings; and generate fresh insights about works of literature that have had a central and enduring influence on both our scholarly traditions and the history of libraries and librarianship.

It discusses the area's theoretical aims and conditions while offering a short review of selected case studies which demonstrate the merit of the approach. The paper joins present epistemological discussions about combining the expertise of the sciences and humanities and takes a pragmatic stance between the normative exhortation for the scientific study of religions and the discussion of innovative methodological horizons emerging from digital humanities. The central position is dedicated to the practice of ""formalizing modeling"" and its possible research utility in the historically grounded study of religions. On the one hand, the article notices the limited contribution of the cognitive science of religion project to a historiographical study of religions. On the other hand, the article discusses the limits of conventional historiography arising from an orientation to the histories of events and persons rather than to histories of so-called ""long duration"". Generally, the paper argues for the complementing of the ""close reading"" of historical sources with ""distant reading"" and hypothesis-driven research utilizing a variety of formal modeling approaches (GIS, agent-based modeling, complex networks) and computer-based methods. The discussed methods offer new ways of representing data and are understood not only as innovative means of solving historical problems but also as a platform for asking new questions based on the fusion of scientific and humanistic imaginations. © 2018 Masarykova Univerzita.

Especially, when the necessary condition of folklore is fixed the motive of human, the need of expressing oneself and creativity instead of face to face interactions, it becomes more evident that the virtual environment is a factor that can provide the sufficient condition for folkloric production. When dealt with in this context, it could be claimed that domesticated virtual environment in which or on which socio-cultural activities can be performed have evolved a new folkloric experience domain that makes possible the emergence of original and even authentic folkloric performances and productions. The aspects of this situation that directly interest folklore studies are that communication and interaction technologies in generally and Internet in particular anymore have become a main factor of folkloric production and that many new, creative and hybrid cultural expressions which have some folkloric qualities have emerged in the generated virtual contexts. Here, in this study which problematized whether virtual environment is appropriate for cultural production in general and folkloric production in particular will be discussed the folklorization of virtual environment rather than virtualization of folklore according to specified parametres. Hence, it will be tried to reveal how cultural environment and contexts that are generated through digital communication technology have turn into an area of experience which is almost equivalent to oral environment over time. © 2018, Milli Folklor Dergisi.

This document shows the creation process for the Cronos system and the manner in which its functionality has been adapted to the specifications required by the Heterochronicity project. Generated by María Cuevas Riaño and Antonio Labella Martinez (Faculty of Fine Art, Complutense University of Madrid) and Salvador Sancha Ros (CEO, Eneso Tecnología de Adaptación), its aim is to reflect on the concept of time-art. In this version of the system, we can observe the presence of time in the reproductive sequence of living organisms (rhythm, duration, behavioural pattern, etc.). This is recorded digitally and reinterpreted on the basis of a musical score, written in line with the authors’ criteria, which is used to define the manner in which the public should interact with the proposed installation, so the observer can experience the concept of presence and time. Thanks to the trans-disciplinary work, which has included art theory, artistic production and computer engineering, it has been possible to build a discourse around the visualisation of data-time, to propose an experimental exhibition space and to define the strategies for spectator-user participation.

This article will propose ways in which we, as educators, can harness the distractions that new technologies can pose to teaching and research towards productive models of distributed attention and collective intelligence. By reflecting on the relationship between play and pedagogy through critical theory, as well as on the benefits of hyper-connected and collaborative learning, this article hopes to expand the branch of Digital Humanities that Holly Willis terms as the “cinematic humanities.” Remixing, recontextualization, and the non-linear/non-sequential reconfiguration of information can provide us with new modes of distributed attention and critical making in the digital age. This article focuses on low and no-budget process-oriented collaborative projects for Cinema, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities courses (adjustable to other subject matters) that incorporate remixing, social and locative media, and augmented reality into experimental modes of connected and collaborative learning. The first assignment is a live film scoring remix, where students collectively brainstormed on picking sound clips/samples to add new soundtracks to early silent films. Remixing practices can offer new insights into cinema's legacy and challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in this case, reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image and reflecting on how our minds attempt to process the impulse of sensory synchronization in cinema. The second sample assignment proposes new ways of using easy-to-learn and accessible GIS (Geographic Information System) and AR (Augmented Reality) tools to create projects related to civic engagement and local/online activism. The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes are meant to be active disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit what digital humanities should or should not be, and other issues that often undermine the potential contributions to digital humanities that derive from the intellectual and material labor that happens in the networked, expanded and distributed classroom. The remix aesthetic, the “unfinished” and makeshift nature of these projects is something that I find adds value to this kind of process-oriented pedagogy because it remains in touch with the pre-institutionalized experimental ethos that prompted the formation of the digital humanities and other disciplinary cross-pollinations. © 2018, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

In the spirit of the piece, this article is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between a curator, a media art conservator, a computer scientist, and a scholar of the digital liberal arts, which brings together these different areas of expertise to offer an innovative and multi-faceted consideration of one artwork from a digital humanities perspective. © 2018, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged in DH a bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g. [Deegan and McCarthy] [Griffin and Hayler 2016] [Hayler and Griffin 2016]), we analyse three types of DH collaboration: 1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3) machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement with collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through how DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest that understanding these entanglements facilitates a critical DH in which academic hierarchies and disciplinary preconceptions are challenged. © 2018, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

It reports on courses taught at NC State University and elsewhere which use digital humanities pedagogy under the aegis of studying transformations in “reading.” With attention to the mediation of attention itself, these courses can cultivate habits of self-reflection to aid students in any disciplinary pathway. Furthermore, digital humanities pedagogy can offer a transferable project-based model of instruction, helping students to develop metacognitive skills as well as to acculturate to different environments across campus. Ultimately, this essay underscores the need to articulate strategies of educational transfer in digital pedagogy. © 2018, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

In this paper, we concentrate on a specific subfield of machine learning called predictive analytics and its use in digital humanities. Predictive analytics has evolved from descriptive analytics, which creates summaries of data, while predictive analytics predicts relationships within the data that also help to explain new data. Predictive analytics uses machine learning techniques but also traditional statistical methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict another target feature in the data. Machine learning is used by predictive analytics to establish the rules that given a certain combination of features make the target more or less likely. Predictive analytics can thus be considered to be a technique to machine-read data. The paper discusses the background of predictive analytics, its use for predicting the past and finally presents a case study in predicting past gender relations in a historical dataset. Predicting the past is introduced as a method to explore relationships in past data. © 2018, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

The characteristic echoed with Ming Dynasty's ""Wuzhong Wenyuan"". The Suzhou book collectors had significant influence on the regional collection culture at Suzhou during the Ming Dynasty, and even on the collection culture all over the country. Generally speaking, the social linkages between ancient book collectors can be categorized into four categories, namely through linkages via consanguinity (relationship by blood), affinity (relationship by marriage), same school of thoughts, or friendship. However, historical records on these four linkages are enormous and fragmented. Processing and analyzing such records is difficult. Therefore, this study attempts to utilize digital humanity technology by selecting the social community analysis software to conduct in-depth analysis on Suzhou book collectors in Ming Dynasty, aims to depict the four major social network models of the Suzhou book collectors, and to identify the heritage or connection through the difference periods. The study also aims to identify the core social groups among the Suzhou book collector communities in Ming Dynasty during different periods, and to provide answers questions such as the identity of core members in the social communities. The result may be different from the academic community previous perception, and can serve as a good clarification, and another good reference to the public. © 2018 Tamkang University.",Book collector communities,Digital humanities,Ming Dynasty,Suzhou,,,,,Chen K.-C.,Chen B.-Y.,Huang C.-C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In ""Models and Modelling between Digital and Humanities - A Multidisciplinary Perspective""' we refrain from providing a normative definition of 'model' and 'modelling' and rather attempt at encircling the current state of the art. In the first instance this chapter provides a very brief overview on modelling as intended as a research strategy applied to scientific fields in the 20th-21st centuries. This overview is followed by a short introduction to modelling in digital humanities, focusing on how modelling has developed into a practical strategy and how it has been theorised. The third part of the introduction presents the scope of the project ""Modelling between digital and humanities: Thinking in practice"". The aim of a project workshop held in 2017, of which HSR Supplement 31 collects the proceedings, was to present a multitude of modelling practices from various disciplines together with different theoretical frameworks. The fourth part of this introduction offers an overview of each of the papers in that volume. Finally, a fifth section constitutes the first item of the proceedings as it reproduces an adaptation of the dialogue which was performed to introduce the main topics of the workshop and the scope of the project at the event itself. It serves to illustrate the way we organised the workshop and how the exchanges amongst participants were facilitated. © GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences.

Therefore, an innovative integration of digital technologies into museum practice and professional development courses is of great importance. In this article we describe three case studies involving knowledge exchange between universities and cultural heritage institutions. All three projects involved interdisciplinary expertise and the use of novel digital technologies which allow the recording of highly accurate 3D data for the purposes of archiving, research, preservation and public engagement. The first case study is a collaboration between The Postal Museum, the London Museum Group and UCL's Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE) department, which delivered a feasibility study in to the use of 3D technologies for the documentation of metal objects. The second is a project involving UCL CEGE, UCL Digital Humanities and The Wellcome Trust in London, consisting of a training workshop, the development of a new low cost 3D imaging kit and outreach activities. The final study, initiated by the German Maritime Museum together with the Jade University of Applied Science in Oldenburg, is developing a 3D acquisition protocol for monitoring the Bremen Cog, a 14th century ship. Concluding the article are reflections on the lessons learnt and recommendations for fostering capacity building and knowledge exchange.

Did Gaius Julius Caesar write de bello hispaniensi?

Of these war memoirs, the Civil War has been confirmed to be Caesar's work, as have the first seven of the eight chapters of the Gallic War, with the eighth authored by Caesar's lieutenant Aulus Hirtius. However, the author-ship of the African War, Alexandrine War, and Spanish War, though attributed to Caesar, is still under debate. Methods of distributional seman-tics derive representations of words from their distribution across large amounts of text, such that words that occur in similar contexts will have similar representations. These representations can then be combined to model larger units of text, such as chapters and entire books. The current work uses one such method, Random Indexing, to calculate the similarity between chapters or books. The results show that the Gallic War's eighth chapter is significantly different both from its other seven chapters and from the Civil War, verifying the utility of Random Indexing models as a means to detect different Latin authorships. The African War, Alexandrine War, and Spanish War are also significantly different from those chapters acknowl-edged to be authored by Caesar, suggesting that he did not write these three. Furthermore, the African War, Alexandrine War, and Spanish War are different from each other, and from the Civil War and Gallic War, suggest-ing that they were each written by a different author. This project demon-strates the value of methods of distributional semantics in Classics research. Of note, these methods do not require manual selection or engineering of features for similarity measures, which distinguishes them from the majority of prior statistical and machine-learning methods of authorship attribution. The implications of distributional semantics for digital humanities and related problems such as the evolution of languages over time and plagiarism detection are discussed. © The author.

Many of the cities called up in this collection have physical presence, places such as Darwin, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Paris, Berlin, Venice, Havana, and Kuching. Other cities conjured here may morph into various otherworldly forms such as haunted spaces or spaceships; or dissolve into a hazy backdrop as memory and imagination take the stage. Yet these urban spaces are nevertheless always alive, their virtual presence becomes the matrix that holds the imagination. The literary and creative works examined here flow from martial arts, through literary works including novels, short stories, poetry, and speculative fiction, and then transition into visual art through science-fiction magazine covers, art on walls and heritage arts spaces, to come to a close with film. © 2018 'Tropical Imaginaries in Living Cities'.",Cities,Digital humanities,Ecology,Feminism,Film,Imagination,Literature,Martial arts,Lundberg A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Naive and game in primitivism as a strategy for overcoming post-modern relativism,0,10.17516/1997-1370-0235,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057260811&doi=10.17516%2f1997-1370-0235&partnerID=40&md5=436c3ad14fc087b66c3b1bcc9e155acc,"The task of high culture of our time is to resolve the conflict between the relativistic way of thinking and the life-giving commitments of art. The aesthetics and ideology of postmodernism pretend to correspond to relativistic gnosis, philosophical criticism points to its secondary nature, multiplication of entropy, lack of perspective. The return to the value paradigm of thinking, but with the preservation of the deep reflexivity of the form, has actualized a model of creativity – literary primitivism – that is not canonical in form but is traditional in the system of values. Its spiritual and aesthetic program is the restoration after a deconstruction of a whole and clear world outlook, the image found is a naive consciousness. The comparative method of analysis showed the content of literary polemics that is an attack on naive and naive apology at the turn of the 20th-21st centuries. The value relativism of postmodern conceptualism exploits the mask of non-reflexive simplicity in D.A. Prigov’s poems, the stories of V. Sorokin. The simple-minded willpower consciousness protects the vital meaning: faith, love, patriotism, humanism, compassion. The literature of the high naive shows children’s immediacy, following the commandment “Be like children” (poems and prose of T. Kibirov, historiosophy of V. Sharov), sympathizes with “ fools” (prose of V. P’etsukh, O. Zaionchkovskii), depicts blessed ones (verses by M. Stepanova, drama by V. Levanov and L. Petrushevskaia), revives the fairy tale (L. Petrushevskaia, O. Zaionchkovskii). The poetics of the primitive, which is simplicity, clarity, emotional contagion, the original “artlessness” of the form, is represented in parafolkloristic plots, images of heroes-simpletons, sentimental narratives. The gravity to naive is spontaneous; it cannot grow into a direction, but expresses the conscious strategy of authors. Naive declared itself in lyric and satire, prose, essays and drama, which indicates a deliberate polemic with ideas, anthropology and the aesthetics of relativism. Systematicity is manifested in the fact that the naive opposes postmodernism in almost all key points of sociology, the philosophy of creativity and the poetics of its expression. Relativism is opposed to ontological consciousness – not in pretentious, but in organic forms, laughter as a way of cognition, existence, criticism and affirmation of meanings. Anatural anthropology opposes the image of a simpleton in a variety of life, behavioral modifications: the blessed, the fool, the child, the wise skeptic, national poet. Naive is a resource, a justification and an image of modern humanism. The paper reviews the meaning and development of digital humanities giving the ex-amples of work published in various DH areas. The paper discusses what using these technologies means for the humanities, giving recommendations that can be useful across the sector. © Siberian Federal University.

Its flagship component, Lomax’s “cantometric” analysis of approximately 1,800 songs from 148 worldwide populations using 36 classificatory features, sparked extensive debate. While Lomax responded to some criticisms, neither his final conclusions nor the evidence on which they were based were ever fully made clear. For decades, neither cantometrics nor Lomax’s related projects involving dance, speech, popular music, digital humanities, pedagogy, and activism were widely adopted by other researchers, but there has been a resurgence of interest since Lomax’s death in 2002. Here, I provide a comprehensive critical review of the Cantometrics Project, focusing on issues regarding the song sample, classification scheme, statistical analyses, interpretation, and ethnocentrism/reductionism. I identify misunderstandings, improvements that were made, and criticisms that remain to be addressed, and distil Lomax’s sometimes-conflicting claims into diagrams summarizing his three primary results: (1) ten regional song-style types, (2) nine musical factors representing intra-musical correlations, and (3) correlations between these musical factors and five factors of social structure. Although Lomax’s interpretations regarding correlations between song style and social structure appear weakly supported, his historical interpretations regarding connections ranging from colonial diaspora to ancient migrations provide a more promising starting point for both research and teaching about the global arts. While Lomax’s attempts to correlate features of social structure such as gender, religion, politics, and economics with stylistic features of musical performance largely failed to gain acceptance, the Cantometrics Project can still provide both inspiration and cautionary lessons for future exploration of relationships between music and culture. © The Author(s) 2018.",Cross-cultural,cultural evolution,ethnomusicology,performance style,science,,,,Savage P.E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transformative power of digital humanities in teaching family history online,1,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053800484&partnerID=40&md5=197db0d89190786c4dae04481b8c4d51,"This paper explores the transformative power of digital humanities in teaching family history online to large cohorts of Australian domestic students. It takes as a case study a unit developed specifically for students to learn about how to research their convict ancestors’ lives and how to situate their ancestors’ lived experiences within relevant wider contexts. Its focus is twofold. The convergence of rapidly expanding digital repositories and databases of family history-related information and increasingly sophisticated online teaching platforms and how this has facilitated a shift from face-to-face to fully online learning and teaching is examined. The ways in which this transformative change was engineered through the unit design, delivery, and evaluative processes are then canvassed. The case study demonstrates how, with thoughtful, well-structured, and innovative approaches to design and by adopting a bespoke delivery model for online delivery, students can readily learn to access and engage critically with extensive online resources and can be equipped with the digital tools to use these optimally and to their satisfaction. © 2018, University of Wollongong.

The global visibility of the African writer, like many academics in African universities, is challenged by digital migration, digital illiteracy or aliteracy. This study problematizes this digital exclusion from the contemporary digital world on account of the multiple dimensions of digital divide; and social and intellectual denial of access to the global literary forum.

Vega constantly mentions specific city addresses, street intersections, locales of public meetings and happenings, detailed routes of his commutes and promenades, etc. The Memoirs are, among other things, an eminently spatial text. A “spatial” reading of the Memoirs of Bernardo Vega is epistemologically and methodologically important for mainly two reasons: first, it will provide an example of how spatial information—when available—should be deemed vital when reading texts (of fiction or non-fiction); for in many cases our spatial awareness of texts adds richness, complexity and alternative narratives to our understanding of these texts; and second, and more immediately relevant to the field of Latino and Puerto Rican Studies, a spatially aware reading of this specific text will show how Bernardo Vega was in fact “mapping out,” claiming geographic ownership of, significant parts of New York City for the Puerto Rican community. © 2018, Hunter College Center for Puerto Rican Studies.

Networking women translators in Spain (1868-1936) and their presence in the Mnemosyne digital library,3,10.1108/EL-02-2017-0026,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045137032&doi=10.1108%2fEL-02-2017-0026&partnerID=40&md5=7b3e8a65a5bb85c76bd3ff64fac94adb,"Purpose: Studies of Spanish literature during the late nineteenth century and the first one-third of the twentieth century are evolving from research on canonical writers to the study of “odd and forgotten” authors, themes and genres during what is now called the Other Silver Age. This paper aims to focus on the work undertaken in the field of literary translation by the women writers of this period. Design/methodology/approach: Mnemosyne is an open-access digital library that allows data modeling for specific collections (women translators, science fiction, etc.) in support of research and teaching on Silver Age Spain. The first version of the library is stored on the server at the Universidad Complutense Library, and it is linked to the collections of the digital library HathiTrust and Biblioteca Nacional de España. Behind the scenes of Mnemosyne’s public presence online, the project is developing with the aid of the tool Clavy which is a rich internet application that is able to import, preserve and edit information from big data collections of digital objects so as to build bridges between institutional and digital repositories and create collections of enriched digital content. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/queesmnemosine.php Findings: The Collection Women Translators in Spain (1868-1936) inside Mnemosyne selects, categorizes and makes visible in digital format women translators and literary translations that belong to a forgotten repertoire to allow the historical review of the period. The digital collection of Spanish Women Translators pretends to be a field of international experimentation for the creation of interoperable semantic networks through which a large group of scholars could generate innovative research and theoretical reading models for literary texts. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/colecciones.php Research limitations/implications: Clavy also provides a basic system of data visualization, edition and navigation. There are plans to integrate @Note, a collaborative annotation application, into Clavy. These two computational tools were developed by the software languages research group ILSA[1] at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Practical implications: Its been followed NEWW Women Writers’ categories concerning biographical categories as successful standard for ensuring interoperability in the near future: children, marital status, social class, religion, profession and other activities, financial aspects, memberships. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/ver_documento.php?documento=208369 Social implications: These women also showed their interest in the writings of contemporary women by translating their works into Spanish or glossing foreign ideas about how the modern woman should be, think or behave. This digital collection shows the first steps of the intellectual women in the South of Europe. Originality/value: To incorporate specially tailored metadata for the women translators’ collection into Mnemosyne, it will be necessary to use of Clavy’s extensibility to account for the particularities of the women translators’ collection. This is where prior knowledge of this literature’s historical and cultural context proves indispensable. In particular, the specific metadata model for the women translators’ collection incorporates elements that reflect the literary, historical and cultural characteristics of the collections. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities,Mnemosyne,Spanish women translators,Womens issues,,,,,Romero López D.,Bueren Gómez-Acebo J.L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper offers an analysis, from a Critical Theory perspective, of a key element of this critique: the theory vs. practice debate, which, in the digital humanities, is translated into the famous “hack” vs. “yack” motto, where DHers usually call for the pre-eminence of the former over the latter. I show how this debate aims to criticise the social situation of employment in academia in the digital age and can further be interpreted with the culture industry theoretical concept, as a continuance of the domination of the intellectual labour (i.e. yack in this case) over manual labour (hack). I argue that, pushing this debate to its very dialectical limit, one realises that the two terms are not in opposition anymore: the actual theory as well as the actual practice are below their very critical concepts in the current situation of academic labour. Therefore, I call for a reconfiguration of this debate, aiming at the rediscovering of an actual theory in the academic production, as well as a rediscovering of a praxis, the latter being outside of the scientific realm and rules: it is political. © 2018, Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

With the popularity of digital technology and mobile computing, Digital Human Geography in both theory and practice have emerged many new potentials and development opportunities. However, the research field regarding digital human geography can cover many areas, such as: mobile augmented reality, local media and service design, urban space interaction, virtual mixed space, space humanistic experience, historical materials reproduction, creativity of digital local sense, cultural narrative and art experience, local action games, mobile learning, and location-related business applications etc. This study aims to transfer information to specific groups through a simple and straightforward manner. With digital technology in combination with humane digital contents, people under the scenario of interactive interface are allowed to apply geographic information system (GIS) and geo-fencing program to convert data into visual images and through today’s Infographics to clearly use visual design characteristics in content presentation. Therefore, our study was to develop a new App, called “Ai Guang Zhan”. People can use “Ai Guang Zhan” App to integrate all exhibition related services. The App can be downloaded from smartphone or tablet PC for users to search in any time the arts and cultural activities and public facilities in the nearest place and receive instant mobile navigation services among various cultural and creative parks. To understand the preference and satisfaction by the people who use the UI interface for the APP designed from the study, a random questionnaire survey will be conducted in Huashan Cultural and Creative Industry Park and Songshan Cultural and Creative Park. The survey results will be used as reference for function improvement of next APP version. The primary purpose of this research is to propose a model for the development of applications, as well as methods for a clearer and easier visual presentation of information to be used as a reference for practitioners or application designers. The application, developed by the study through the proposed processes, was found to be effective; the developed application could be utilized as a new and useful tool to facilitate the utilization of academic and cultural resources. Additionally, users’ specific comments and suggestions collected by the study could be adopted as a reference for future application development. The application developed by this study was found to serve effectively as a method to promote the development of art and cultural activities of all sizes in various regions, and stimulate the exchange of arts and humanities between urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the application has the ability to attract younger people to participate in art and cultural activities, find their own interests, and explore more corresponding activities with its assistance. Future applications associated to art and cultural activities are suggested to effectively integrate AR, GIS, and visual design (such as Infographics) technologies, and thereby offer users more diversified, convenient, and useful functions. Restricted by the resources of labor and limited time, the functional design and development of the application still requires improvement. Specifically, the combination of AR technology and information presentation of art and cultural activities, as well as the calculation of relative distance and travel time were not presented effectively. The next step of the project would involve revising the content and functionalities of the application based on users’ feedback collected by this study, reviewing the acceptance of market responses of the application, and seeking a development company or foundation for technology transfer. Moreover, we intend to combine more technologies such as diversified cross-platform functions, visualized design of information, and interactive devices to further improve the application, and thereby stimulate social, human, and geographical interactions. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,,,,,,,Chiu C.-C.,Lee L.-C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moving between a formal and a historically situated analysis, I will relate practices of modelling of handwriting in digital palaeography to modelling in digital humanities more generally.

Automatic Maya glyph analysis provides an efficient way to assist scholars' daily work. We introduce the Histogram of Orientation Shape Context (HOOSC) shape descriptor to the Digital Humanities community. We discuss key issues for practitioners and study the effect that certain parameters have on the performance of the descriptor. Different HOOSC parameters are tested in an automatic ancient Maya hieroglyph retrieval system with two different settings, namely, when shape alone is considered and when glyph co-occurrence information is incorporated. Additionally, we developed a graph-based glyph visualization interface to facilitate efficient exploration and analysis of hieroglyphs. Specifically, a force-directed graph prototype is applied to visualize Maya glyphs based on their visual similarity. Each node in the graph represents a glyph image; the width of an edge indicates the visual similarity between the two according glyphs. The HOOSC descriptor is used to represent glyph shape, based on which pairwise glyph similarity scores are computed. To evaluate our tool, we designed evaluation tasks and questionnaires for two separate user groups, namely, a general public user group and an epigrapher scholar group. Evaluation results and feedback from both groups show that our tool provides intuitive access to explore and discover the Maya hieroglyphic writing, and could potentially facilitate epigraphy work. The positive evaluation results and feedback further hint the practical value of the HOOSC descriptor. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of EADH.

However, academic researchers in a variety of fields are interested in the same type of data to gain insights in the Web behaviour of users. Digital Humanities scholars interested in the use of digital collections are, e.g., interested in the navigation paths of users to these collections. In our case we wanted (1) to analyse the way news consumers visit news websites and (2) understand how these websites fit in their daily news consumption patterns. Until now most common applied scholarly research methods to analyse online user behaviour focus on analyses of log files provided by website owners or recalled user behaviour by survey, diary, or interview methods. Only recently scholars started to experiment with gathering real-world data of Web behaviour by monitoring a group of respondents. In this article we describe the set-up of 'The Newstracker', a tool that primarily allowed us to analyse online news consumption of a group of young Dutch news users on their desktop and laptop computers. We demonstrate the workflow of the Newstracker and how we designed the data collection and pre-processing phase. By reflecting on the technical, methodological, and analytical challenges we encountered, we illustrate the potential of online monitoring tools such as the Newstracker. We end our article with discussing its limitations by stressing the need for a multimethod study design when aiming not only to analyse but also to understand online user behaviour. © The Author 2017.

Dialogism in the novel: A computational model of the dialogic nature of narration and quotations,8,10.1093/llc/fqx031,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042606999&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqx031&partnerID=40&md5=244260a06ba59f9b44152f62e6075ef7,"Understanding how spoken language is represented in novels over time is a key question in the Digital Humanities. We propose a new metric for characterizing spoken dialogue in the novel, called dialogism, that instantiates Bakhtin's claim that all texts are fundamentally dialogic. This measurement uses abstract grammatical features in a span of text (such as the use of pronouns, mood, or subordinate clause structure) to measure the extent to which the span is dialogic, i.e. exhibits the grammatical structures common to natural spoken dialogue. We use this metric to explore the dialogism of 1,100 largely canonical English novels over 230 years. We combine quantitative and qualitative investigation of the dialogic properties of both dialogue and narration to show novel stylistic properties of literary innovation during three periods: the late 18th century, the turn of the 19th century, and the mid-20th century. We find that during these moments, certain authors reject literary conventions by changing the dynamic between the narrative and dialogue portions of the texts. Our analysis shows that these changed dynamics are behind rises in persuasive writing, reflections of psychological processes, and the use of dialogue as an increasingly important driver of the novel as a whole. These results show that computational models that characterize style grammatically, generalizing across time and genre, can lead to literary and methodological insights. © The Author 2017.

We can do so by building new metadata from text and images for recommender systems to reorganize and reshape the archive. In the process, we can remix and reframe the archive allowing users to mine the archive in multiple ways whilemaking visible the organizing logics that shape interpretation. To show how recommender systems can shape the digital humanities, we will look closely at how they are used in digital media and then applied to the digital humanities by focusing on the Photogrammar project, a Web platform showcasing US government photography from 1935 to 1945. © The Author 2017.

We focus on lemmatization, a basic step in many processing pipelines in the Digital Humanities. While this task has long been considered solved for modern languages such as English, there exist many (e.g. historic) languages for which the problem is harder to solve, due to a lack of resources and unstable orthography. Our approach is based on recent advances in the field of 'deep' representation learning, where neural networks have led to a dramatic increase in performance across several domains. The proposed system combines two approaches: on the one hand, we apply temporal convolutions to model the orthography of input words at the character level; secondly, we use distributional word embeddings to represent the lexical context surrounding the input words. We demonstrate how this system reaches state-ofthe- art performance on a number of representative Middle Dutch data sets, even without corpus-specific parameter tuning. © The Author 2016.

In the UK, it is becoming more common for research projects to embrace public engagement with the belief that it informs research, enhances teaching and learning, and increases research impact on society. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to consider ways of incorporating public engagement activities into digital humanities research. This article discusses public engagement and digital humanities in practice, highlighting how museums are utilizing digital technology to engage the public. This article describes the development and presents the results of a case study: The QRator project, an application for digital interpretation in the museum and cultural heritage sector. The QRator project took an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to creating new ways for museum visitors to engage with museum objects and discussions. The objective was to understand how digital technologies, such as interactive labels and smartphones, create new ways for users to engage with museum objects; investigate the value and constraints of digital sources and methods involving cultural content; and demonstrate how crowdsourced digital interpretation may be utilized as a research source. This article will use the QRator project as a case study to explore how mobile devices and interactive digital labels can create new models for public engagement, visitor meaningmaking (Silverman, L. H. Visitor meaning-making in museums for a new age. Curator, 1995;38(3):161-70), and the construction of multiple interpretations inside museum spaces.

Often characterized as enabling a unifying as well as transformative sentiment for the Humanities as a whole, Digital Humanities can be described as a challenging hybridization of scholarly practices contingent to social and cultural contexts. The core of the paper relates to one of the topics of the 2015 conference on Rethinking Humanities, namely digital memory, by recalling on the concept of Humanities as scholarship engaged with meaning-making practices connecting past and present. Building on the literature and some co-authored research 1, I present a humanities-informed theorization of modelling in Digital Humanities as a meaning-making practice enacted in the present and aiming at repurposing the past. As privileged objects of digital modelling activities, texts are repurposed via the creation and manipulation of (digital) external representations. An informed theory of textuality reminds us how cultural products embed the processes of their creations and uses. Can digital models enact such practical memory and become in themselves strategies to exercise memory and encode knowledge?.",,,,,,,,,Ciula A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By buttonology, we do not mean the study of buttons, nor do we intend the derision of August Strindberg, who, in his story “The Isle of the Blessed,” coined the word buttonology to mock scholarly pedantry. Buttonology is, in its simplest terms, software training that surveys different features of an interface in an introductory manner. In a library one-shot, teaching the library discovery system or showing how to perform an advanced search in a database would be buttonology. Knowing how to upload texts into a tool like Voyant does not help researchers think about what texts should be uploaded, how selecting data relates to a research question, or even what constitutes an effective research question. This type of teaching does not encourage critical thinking, yet digital humanities instruction, in our experience, is frequently focused on showing how to use software rather than reflect on the broader context. © John E.

Across disciplines, this set of approaches has emerged concurrently with the arrival of increasingly powerful computing technologies. This paper examines the novel Exchange Place by Ciaran Carson, applying Katherine Hayles’s concept of ‘chaotics’ to the text to read for established chaotic features including unpredictability, complex forms, nonlinear relationships and multi-scalar representations. Foregrounding interactions between chaotics as proposed in the 1990s and contemporary post-digital environments, I highlight three distinguishing elements of Exchange Place, which are explained and illustrated through close reading, that reflect an evolving, twenty-first-century chaotics; I have termed these pulsating subjectivity, mercurial body-text and collective mind. Crucial to this discussion are evolutions in subjectivity in the post-digital age, where bodies and texts have become deeply embedded with, and within, high-tech communication networks. The result is a new horizon of textual strategies and effects that privilege network-ecologies of personhood over individuality and coherence; Exchange Place is a quintessential illustration of this literary horizon. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chaotics,Digital humanities,Post-digital literature,Posthumanism,Technology and literature,,,,Barrios-O’neill D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wave of post-war writing responded playfully to informatics in a pre-digital period through an engagement with physics, entropy and post-structuralist theory. In an era dominated by neuroscientific revolutions, fiction written in the digital age addresses the pressing information overload debate with a new seriousness, often stressing concerns about the impact on the human mind. Contemporary fictional writing depicts an increasingly immersive online experience that accelerates information processing by human minds under technostress. New phenomena such Big Data and ‘infobesity’ affect not only writing practice but stretch the mainstream novel form to its representational limits. Mainstream literature is critical of the changing the shape of our lives and minds at the level of content, yet fails to find new forms of storytelling.

Consequently addresses that no longer exist have to be geolocated and visualized on historical basemaps and spaces must be represented diachronically; (4) the design of web map application needs to balance both sophisticated research requirements and a user-friendly interface; (5) finally contributors expect their data to be cited or acknowledged when used in other studies and users need metadata and citation information in order to reuse and repurpose datasets.

This corpus operationalizes the western canon based on Harold Bloom’s The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages (1994). The paper describes the development of the corpus, its organization and source material. Corpus procedures are applied to the corpus, such as word frequency analysis, lemmatization and keyness, to demonstrate its potential uses in culturomics and corpus stylistics, two interdisciplinary fields between the traditional and digital humanities, and the linguistic and literary approaches to literature. Culturomics is the study of culture and social psychology via the investigation of corpora of literature as cultural artefacts, while corpus stylistics is the application of corpus linguistics to traditional literary scholarship.

Focusing on the production of what Vilém Flusser calls ‘technical images’ in video art and new media projects, he suggests that the experiment in experimental art may be rethought as a method for testing concepts and observations through the application of media technology as an apparatus. The technical image is a time-critical way to understand automatic image making devices and using this method of analysis he identifies examples where artists and humanities scholars have programmed devices to experiment with the time of contemporary media culture. Beginning with an analysis of Mark Hansen and Ben Rubin’s two works Listening Post and Moveable Type, the author uses a number of examples, from contemporary experiments with digital media to the experiments with video in the 1970s and 1980s, to show how artists and humanities scholars have used technical images to engage in experimental research outside the controlled laboratory of scientific experiments. If experimental scientists test scientific problems by developing, programming and applying an apparatus, the experimental artists identified in this article can likewise be seen to test aesthetic and cultural problems by similarly redesigning, scaling-up and experimentally applying media technology. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",digital humanities,"experimental art, time and media technology",experimental research in the arts and humanities,new media,technical image,Vilém Flusser,,,Barker T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modularity maximization partition was also performed to both co-citation and “author bibliographic coupling” networks to identify main research interests manifested in the literature. The results show that, as publications in digital humanities continue to grow, its diversity and coherence, two hallmarks of interdisciplinarity, have shown signs of becoming more robust. The co-author network, however, remained rather fragmented, with collaboration mainly limited by language and geographic boundaries.

The rise and fall of the colonial penal settlements involved monumental and rapid population movements that were meticulously documented by the colonial authorities. Nevertheless, despite some key works in recent years, there exists a rather meagre understanding of the processes by which the penal settlements were populated, and of the composition and status of their populations.

Pasts and futures of digital humanities in musicology: Moving towards a “Bigger Tent”,8,10.1080/10588167.2017.1404301,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041117357&doi=10.1080%2f10588167.2017.1404301&partnerID=40&md5=f67da6ef0e0c44a9165e9077b65eccf0,"Musicologists and music theorists have traditionally been early adopters of technological tools to assist with research. The earliest digital humanities projects in musicology and music theory came directly out of humanities computing and quantitative analytical technologies developed in the 1980s, but newer projects created since the mid-2000s still reflect this past of algorithmic analysis and archival compilation, retrieval, and display. Computational and archival research is, currently, only one branch of digital humanities. The umbrella of digital humanities research now also includes digital publishing, philosophies of digital research, and “born digital” projects that cannot exist outside of a digital medium (e.g., virtual reality or 3D modeling). This shift in the digital humanities represents a move to a “bigger tent” that includes more types of projects. Musicological and musico-theoretical scholarship is slowly moving in this direction. Music librarians have been at the forefront of identifying and promoting new digital tools and archives, even though these projects have tended to remain at the periphery of musico-theoretical discourse. They should be on the lookout for “bigger tent” projects, such as medieval and renaissance projects like the Isabelle D’Este Archive, Opening the Geesebook, and the Experience of Worship. These projects are characterized by being iterative and multi-modally engaging, as well as emerging from communities of practice and intentionally engaging a public audience. Music librarians should also be aware of systemic challenges to creating and supporting digital projects because these issues are at the center of libraries supporting all types of digital scholarship. © 2018 Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Digital humanities,Digital scholarship,Music librarianship,Music theory,Musicology,,,,Urberg M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, oral history methodologies and practices have placed emphasis on working with transcribed textual surrogates, rather than the digital audio files created during the interview process. This provides a pragmatic access to the basic semantic content, but obviates access to other potentially meaningful aural information; our work addresses the potential for methods to explore this extra-semantic information, by working with the audio directly. Audio analysis tools, such as those developed within the established field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR), provide this opportunity. This article describes the application of audio analysis techniques and methods to spoken word collections. We demonstrate an approach using freely available audio and data analysis tools, which have been explored and evaluated in two workshops. We hope to inspire new forms of content analysis which complement semantic analysis with investigation into the more nuanced properties carried in audio signals. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Audio analysis,Digital history,Music information retrieval,Oral history,,,,,Webb S.,Kiefer C.,Jackson B.,Baker J.,Eldridge A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are Digital Humanities and World Literature establishing themselves as fields utilizing analytical tools that are at odds with the aims and perspectives of feminist literary history and reception history as a part of literary history? We argue that gender research and theory is insufficiently developed in both computational literary history and World Literature. An unproblematic understanding of translations, canonization, English as a global language, and the use of large-scale computational methods and formalized interpretive models is in many cases not beneficial for the understanding of texts by women writers or from feminist perspectives. Drawing on feminist criticism of computational methods and arguments for specialized rather than generalized knowledge about literary history, we propose that digitization in some form, be it a bibliographical database or digitization of a corpus of texts, may be thought of as part of the research process in projects oriented towards gender and cultural exchange. © 2017 The Nordic Association for Women's Studies and Gender Research.",computational methods,digital humanities,gender,literary history,transculturality,World literature,,,Bergenmar J.,Leppänen K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I argue that fields such as the Latinx nineteenth century, which must confront absences in the archive, foreground groundbreaking new pedagogical possibilities that draw on, but are not limited to, the computational methods that the digitization of archival texts has enabled. As scholars of Latinx Studies–as well as those in related fields such as hemispheric studies, black Atlantic studies, and indigenous studies–work to question the assumptions and omissions of our print-dominated past, digitization projects have become sites for recuperating lost voices, for breaking out of the disciplinary formations that have made sense of cultural history to find new patterns, and for increasing participation in the production of knowledge itself. While much of this work to date has centered on opening up new research trajectories, an emerging wave dedicated to digital humanities pedagogy in Latinx studies and related fields is engaging students in remixing, reassembling, and reimagining the archival record. Such new pedagogical approaches call for corresponding educational research methods and tools that can assess the effectiveness of the new digital humanities pedagogy in encouraging reflexivity about what we know and how we know it–and, ultimately, in contributing to the democratization of the production of knowledge. © 2017 International Council for Educational Media.",Digital humanities,Latinx,pedagogy,,,,,,Kreitz K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parallels are drawn between manuscript scholar practices and those of other humanities disciplines. Finally, the implications for information professionals are explored and best practices for assisting digital humanists defined. In particular, community engagement in the process is stressed throughout, as it is the authors’ belief that it is necessary for success. The best practices are in no way exhaustive, and they are intended to be broadly applicable to a range of disciplines within the digital humanities and to librarians. Future work will involve validating a new data management approach informed by this study by testing in the field. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Rachel Di Cresce and Julia King.",Best practices,data management,digital humanities,knowledge organization,manuscripts,scholarly needs,,,Di Cresce R.,King J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the humanities to enrich a technological base would help digital users to explore educational materials in a more humanistic and ethical fashion. An exemplary educational model of teaching language and content is suggested as a way to emphasize this perspective of the humanities. From the humanistic viewpoints, digital users can develop their critical awareness such that they can expand their thoughts to consider the well-being of persons, thus perceiving teaching contents from multiple perspectives.

Modern society runs on fossil fuels like oil and coal, two resources that are frequently discussed in part due to their contribution to both positive and negative outcomes. This research uses a digital ecocritical approach to explore a corpus of 60 narratives, both fictional and nonfictional, published between 2002 and 2016 by US authors. We combine text mining methods, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, with selected manual review of texts to posit that American narratives often depict oil as new and exciting, with associated dangers seen as tragic but thrilling. Appalachian coal, by contrast, is portrayed nostalgically, depicted as a nearly familial presence that has betrayed its communities and no longer represents security and prosperity. Thus, while oil is hypothetical and exciting, coal is real and disappointing. Latent cultural attitudes about these and other resources can provide insights as to how Americans view ongoing deployment of energy infrastructure. Further, understanding cultural context can help direct attention to issues of high significance to communities experiencing energy development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Digital humanities,Fossil fuels,Narrative,Text mining,,,,,Grubert E.,Algee-Hewitt M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we classify the observed papers according to a taxonomy of text analysis tasks, categorize applied close and distant reading techniques to support the investigation of these tasks and illustrate approaches that combine both reading techniques in order to provide a multi-faceted view of the textual data. In addition, we take a look at the used text sources and at the typical data transformation steps required for the proposed visualizations.

The SO is based on empirical research and earlier models and is designed so as to incorporate related works through a modular structure. The SO is an elaboration of the domain-independent core part of the NeDiMAH Methods Ontology addressing the scholarly ecosystem of Digital Humanities. It thus provides a basis for developing domain-specific scholarly work ontologies springing from a common root. We define the basic concepts of the model and their semantic relations through four complementary perspectives on scholarly work: activity, procedure, resource and agency. As a use case we present a modelling example and argue on the purpose of use of the model through the presentation of indicative SPRQL and SQWRL queries that highlight the benefits of its serialization in RDFS. The SO includes an explicit treatment of intentionality and its interplay with functionality, captured by different parts of the model.

The most recent “spatial turn” among digital humanists can be attributed to both the prevalence of tools like ArcGIS that facilitate such investigations as well as an interdisciplinary convergence upon theoretical models that conceive of socially constructed space. This article will briefly review the current state-of-the-art in the field of Spatial History as well as discuss a number of emerging trends such as deep mapping, digital storytelling and data visualization, utilizing examples from a variety of applications. Moreover, archaeologists can benefit from the substantial investments by the academy in the Digital Humanities, particularly in the United States and Canada. In sum, the article proposes that the scope of archaeological applications of geospatial technologies would be productively broadened through an increased engagement with the Digital Humanities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",data visualization,deep mapping,Digital Humanities,digital storytelling,drones,GIS,Spatial History,,Earley-Spadoni T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Annual conferences held by the Association of Internet Researchers over 3 years are used for data collection. According to our result, while the Twitter communication network developed into a bigger network, the basic form of the network configuration remained stable as a Tight Crowd structure and the core influential people were not much changed.

This has cast a welcome light on creative processes and facilitated innovative solutions. Faculty and students in the sciences, humanities, business and technology now have resources to explore new possibilities and solutions that match their technologic capabilities. However, this framework for creative problem solving falls short in teaching core design and aesthetic principles. The challenge for educators becomes how to build shared learning environments between design and external domains. As an assistant professor in the New Media Design program at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), I have applied core design curriculum in an interdisciplinary program across design, development and digital humanities to begin this shared design education.

These efforts maintain that it is possible to change the widespread view that humanities fields are arcane or irrelevant by changing conceptual frames in ways that show the humanities to be useful, accessible and actionable. Specifically, researchers have been claiming for the humanities frames and concepts from the sciences, such as the humanities “labs” that signal (in both name and design) quantifiability, verifiability and functionality. This tactic of borrowing categories from the sciences is part of a larger tactical turn that we may call “the scientification of the humanities”. The new field of the digital humanities, in particular, is a central site for this turn. With a focus on digital humanities practices, this article aims to describe the tactical meanings, in the humanities, of the borrowed concepts data, collaboration and laboratory, all of which strategically frame the humanities as a practical, innovative and profitable field.

After historicizing cartography as a technique of colonial power, and situating Indigenous counter-mapping as an assertion of political and intellectual sovereignty, we examine the digital map of Amiskwaciwâskahikan (Plains Cree for Edmonton, Alberta) produced by the Pipelines Collective, which overlays Treaty 6 Indigenous maps onto ‘conventional’ maps to denaturalize and challenge colonial renderings of city space. We then discuss the expanding trend of guerrilla mapping techniques engaged in by Indigenous groups, emphasizing the Ogimaa Mikana project in Toronto, wherein Anishinaabemowin names were stickered over settler street names. Expanding the spatial theories of Michel de Certeau and Gilles Deleuze, and drawing on the research and insights of Indigenous scholars Jodi Byrd and Mishuana Goeman, our paper considers how emerging digital counter-mapping efforts offer ambivalent possibilities for Indigenous peoples to assert their presence in material ways. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Cartography,digital humanities,indigenous resurgence,new media studies,,,,,Hunt D.,Stevenson S.A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, concern over current and future weather and climate has triggered a new level of interest in past weather events and their impacts. This interest, alongside the development of digital humanities research methods, has resulted in a rapid growth in the number of online databases relating to historic weather and climate around the world. This paper documents the design, creation and content of one such database, TEMPEST, an online repository for extreme weather history in the UK. TEMPEST has been created as the major output of the AHRC funded project ‘Spaces of Experience and Horizons of Expectation: The Implications of Extreme Weather in the UK, Past, Present and Future’ (2013-2017). Unlike the majority of existing databases that rely on published materials, TEMPEST's records are drawn from primary research into original documentary sources held in archives around the UK. The c. 18,000 records that TEMPEST currently contains offer personalised and geo-referenced insights into the relationship between society and extreme weather in the UK spanning a period of over 400 years. In this paper we outline potential applications for TEMPEST and suggest directions for future research and resources in historical weather. We also consider broader issues for the digital humanities relating to the storage, archiving, ownership, and usage of data and the need to ensure connectivity between complementary datasets.

The concept of patterns, applied to the domain of costumes in films, can help costume designers to improve their work by capturing knowledge and experience about proven solutions for recurring design problems. However, finding such Costume Patterns is a difficult and time-consuming task, because possibly hundreds of different costumes of a huge number of films have to be analyzed to find commonalities. In this paper, we present a Semi-Automated Costume Pattern Mining Method to discover indicators for Costume Patterns from a large data set of documented costumes using data mining and data warehouse techniques.

This corpus, which I call the 'ProppLearner' corpus, was assembled to provide data for an algorithm designed to learn Vladimir Propp's morphology of Russian hero tales. The corpus is the most deeply annotated narrative corpus available at this time. The algorithm and learning results are described elsewhere; here, I provide detail on the layers of annotation and how they were chosen, novel layers of annotation required for successful learning, the selection of the texts for annotation, the annotation process itself, and the resulting inter-annotator agreement measures. In particular, the corpus comprised fifteen texts totaling 18,862 words. There were eighteen layers of annotation, five of which were developed specifically to support learning Propp's morphology: referent attributes, context relationships, event valences, Propp's 'dramatis personae', and Propp's functions. All annotations were created by trained annotators with the Story Workbench annotation tool, following a double-annotation paradigm. I discuss lessons learned from this effort and what they mean for future digital humanities efforts when working with the semantics of natural language text. © The Author 2016.

I begin with a description of a process involving finding racetracks converted into housing developments and move on to a discussion of the mapping of information broadly defined. I looked for references to horse racing, searched maps for their presence, and then went to the modern-day map and satellite image to see if their presence remained. What emerged from my work is the seemingly universal presence of racetracks in almost every location. While I continue to map racetracks in my project on New York City horse racing, a more process-oriented idea of mapping also emerged, a type of mental mapping of how and where racing existed and how one might begin to contextualize these maps, both geographic and mental.",Digital humanities,Horse racing,Mapping,Process,,,,,Silverman J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recognizing this digital divide and the consequential underrepresentation of most languages in any linked open data efforts is a motivation for some solutions offered in this article. Efforts to increase the documentation of the world's small languages have led to the development of tools and repositories over the past decade. However, as not all digital language archives currently provide metadata in standard formats, their collections are invisible to aggregated searches. Other repositories (including many institutional repositories-national libraries and archives, mission archives, and so on) have language content that is not noted in the collection's catalog, so is impossible to locate at all via a search based on language names. Finally, there are collections still held by their creators and not in a repository at all, completely hidden from other potential users. This article suggests that it is a digital humanities project to make more information about the world's small languages more freely available, and identifies several means by which this could be accomplished, including a survey to locate more collections; a register to announce their existence; and a documentation index to provide an overview of what is known for each language. © The Author 2016.

Thereby I mean to move beyond analyzing the shaping of technology within individual infrastructure projects and instead trace in a more encompassing way how dynamics at the institutional and policy level mediate the reorganization of disciplinary tool development. Drawing conceptual inspiration from the work of Sheila Jasanoff, I propose that digital infrastructure actually functions as a regulatory technology, i.e. as an interface through which the different actor groups (researchers, funders, policy makers) rearticulate their mutual relations. European initiatives, I argue, are based on a more centralizing, technology-driven vision of digital infrastructure that serves the European Commission’s policy goal of integrating national research systems in institutional and epistemic terms. This causes a certain disconnect between tool developers and prospective scholarly users who are often unfamiliar with digital approaches, but the emphasis on central coordination also ensures that no single community gains exclusive control over technology development. In the US, by contrast, the original impetus to adopt a concerted strategy for digital infrastructure has not been provided by science policy makers and administrators, but by researchers in the area of digital humanities. These scholars have successfully promoted a sociotechnical view of infrastructure as an emergent, evolutionary phenomenon, which also implies that conceptual and managerial authority should be situated at well-established digital humanities centers. While avoiding problems related to the implementation of technology in more traditional scholarly practices, this arrangement will tend to privilege the intellectual and technological preferences of existing elites within digital humanities over those of other research communities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",cyberinfrastructure,digital humanities,digital infrastructure,European research area,humanities,infrastructure policy,regulatory technology,,Kaltenbrunner W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To this end, we observe information work through interviews with DH scholars about their work practices and through a survey of DH programs such as graduate degrees, certificates, minors, and training institutes. In this study we focus on how the goals behind methodology (a link between theories and method) surface in everyday DH work practices and in DH curricula in order to investigate if the critiques that have appeared in relation to DH information work are well founded and to suggest alternative narratives about information work in DH that will help advance the impact of the field in the humanities and beyond. © 2017 ASIS&T",,,,,,,,,Clement T.E.,Carter D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After analysing the implications that this turn, particularly its digital aspect, may have on a possible mappability of literature and on the definition of an emerging field like spatial humanities, the paper will discuss the broad disciplinary spectrum of digital humanities and its possible convergences with this cartographic and spatialising trend through the changes experienced by the contemporary textual condition (from the large-scale digitation of texts to the spread of multimedia). The paper also explores the split between an eminently quantitative approach and a qualitative one, within both digital and spatial humanities, when tackling the study of texts, whether they be literary or otherwise. This duality leads to the current debate between defenders and detractors of what Franco Moretti dubbed distant reading, a critical practice that opposes the traditional method of close reading. As the paper attempts to argue, that distant perspective is closely linked to the cartographic turn and does not necessarily involve using exclusively quantitative tools and giving up close reading as a means of accessing texts. In this sense, through the underlying concept of some literary GIS and of the emerging notion of deep or thick mapping, the paper argues for the possibility of a telescopic reading which, as part of the approaches and interests of spatial and digital humanities, combines quantitative and qualitative methods and makes a distant focus (that is, cartographic) compatible with a close reading of texts. © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.",Digital humanities,GIS,Literature,Spatial turn,Telescopic reading,,,,Unamuno E.S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper examines the significance of digital technologies for core museum tasks of collecting, investigating and mediating museum object data from the perspective of museology. It is based on the assumption that presentations of museum objects in a virtual space cannot compete with real museum exhibitions, as they cannot replace an encounter with the original object. Additionally, they serve as a medium in their own right. Virtually represented collection complexes can be used as an independent educational tool by linking multi-layered meanings of museum objects. These presuppositions are demonstrated using the example of a physical museum collection. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",museology,museum and digital age,museum computing,Museum documentation,object database,virtual museum,,,Biedermann B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cultural heritage is only ever partially preserved if its context is lost. This contribution argues that the future of conservation should include context as an integral and inalienable part of all forms of cultural heritage. As such, this will require an increase in cross-disciplinary collaborations with, among others, archaeologists, historians and archivists involved in efforts aimed at restoring cultural heritage to the contexts from which it has become disengaged. Based on theoretical frameworks from the digital humanities, cultural theory, history of the built environment and archaeology, the authors outline a method of re-contextualisation using the drowned landscape of Nubia as a case study. Aside from the landscape in which the Nubian monuments once stood and the vernacular of historical Nubian cultures, we argue that the history and socio-political nature of the decisions made in the name of preservation itself should also be incorporated as part of this context. The contribution argues that digital representations coupled with digital archiving provides one means of incorporating such heterogeneous and diverse information to present the contexts in which descriptions, texts, photographs, letters, videos and oral history can be better understood, interpreted and distributed. © 2017 Icon, The Institute of Conservation.",3DVR,cultural landscape,Digital Humanities,Nubia,preservation,UNESCO,,,Tamborrino R.,Wendrich W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is the legacy of the extractive coal industry? When is extraction complete in a single-industry area? Tied to global capital, fuelling the Industrial Revolution on the labour immigrants, the legacy of extraction in the Anthracite Coal-Mining Region in Northeastern Pennsylvania extends into local notions of heritage, memory, community welfare, and place. Tracking (de)industrial life scenes in the Anthracite Coal-Mining Region, this ethnographic work follows traces of the past as they emerge and the day-to-day practices that sustained them noting intensities and flashpoints as they arise in daily life. As a particular flashpoint, Coal Region residents processed the demolition of the ruins of Saint Nicholas Coal Breaker, the last anthracite coal breaker built before 1960 and once the largest coal breaker in the world. Residents rapidly produced and shared digital media of the Breaker with and through a large public digital humanities collaboratory that I created and maintain through an active Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/AnthraciteCoalRegion) of more than 8000 members and a corresponding website (http://anthracitecoalregion.com). Engaging in community dialogue, participatory communication, and offering critical interpretations, residents wrote accounts about the demolition of the Breaker including its historical and mnemonic relevance, the cultural politics surrounding it, and the ethical dimensions of its extraction from the landscape by a mining company engaged in strip-mining on the surrounding land. These connections and dislocations between situated pasts show affective intensities arising suddenly even though dominant or more official narratives may have overwhelmed them. The sanitizing of the landscape of Saint Nicholas Breaker tries to empty the physical place of the material cultural traces of mining people/mined people to re-extract more coal through strip-mining operations, thereby rendering superfluous the underground miners’ labour by removing the last sign of it - the Breaker - from the landscape. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",affect,Anthracite Coal Region,Appalachia,class studies,coal breaker,coal-mining,community media,cultural extraction,Meade M.R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complexity leadership and collective action in the age of networks,3,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018788974&partnerID=40&md5=ad374da169b39ea95c57e671a23a49e8,"Distributed models of leadership and collaborative agency are often mediated across digital networks that are not hierarchical or sequential. As Mary Uhl-Bien and her coauthors discuss, interactive and distributed models of leadership facilitate collaborative agency across dynamic networks, and in doing so they help author the networks themselves. These evolving understandings of those relations are examined in Jessica Enoch and David Gold's 2013 special issue of College English. In their discussion of the methodological implications of the converging concerns of digital humanities and historical studies, Enoch and Gold note that the network era has transformed ""our thinking about literacy, rhetorical practice, and composing writ large"" (105). As Enoch and Gold discuss, scholars in our field ""do not just analyze digital technologies, they produce them"" (108). The changes in authorship that these authors examine parallel the changes in how authority is mediated through networks. They make it clear in their introduction that the digital age is characterized by multiple heterogeneous networks and producers of multimedia and multimodal technologies. Similarly, the environment for leadership is a challenging one-whether leading as editors, administrators in departments and colleges, organizers and collaborators in communities, teachers in classrooms, and/or curriculum and program designers. These two forces-changes in authorship and the influence of connectivity-suggest a necessity to reimagine leadership through the lens of complexity theory. In doing so, the resulting complexity theory of leadership provides a framework for considering how agency is mediated through multimodal forms of authorship that circulate through interconnected networks so as to foster collective action. By valuing and practicing a model of leadership that embraces complexity and interaction, relationships within networks become the driving force for change. © 2017 by the National Council of Teachers of English.",,,,,,,,,Murray J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, an assessment environment and sample applications using this framework are briefly described. Research on Document Image Analysis (DIA) focuses mainly on developing and refining automatic processing steps, e.g. text line extraction, binarization, and layout analysis. While many state-of-the-art methods perform satisfactorily, the algorithms applied to obtain the results are not easily accessible for other researchers. Making the source code available is often not sufficient as it typically requires a cumbersome installation of required libraries and reading long manuals about the usage. We present a new approach for making methods available to researchers in the digital humanities without detailed knowledge of the algorithms. For our approach we propose a RESTful web service architecture, the current state of the art in online web communication. For a developer this reduces the steps needed to access a method to sending and receiving HTTP requests with Java Script Object Notification data, removing all installation steps. We will build on standards such as the Text Encoding Initiative and the International Image Interoperability Framework. Thus, methods hosted on DIVAServices can be integrated easily into document processing workflows by any software engineer in computer science, but also the digital humanities without specific knowledge of the mathematical and algorithmic details of DIA. © The Author 2016.

The assumption behind such efforts is often that trends will emerge from the analysis despite errors for individual data points and that noise will be dominated by the signal in the data. However, for some text analysis tasks, the technology is unable to perform as well as domain experts, perhaps because it does not have sufficient world knowledge or metadata available. Yet, the advantage of language processing technology is that it can process at scale, even if not perfectly accurately. Geo-locating literary works is one example where human expert knowledge is invaluable when it comes to distinguishing between candidate works. This was the underlying assumption in Palimpsest, an interdisciplinary digital humanities research project on mining literary Edinburgh. From the outset, the project adopted an assisted curation process whereby the automatic processing of large data collections was combined with manual checking to identify literary works set in Edinburgh.

In DH, debates continue e.g. in (Gold, Debates in the Digital Humanities. University of Minnesota Press, 2012) regarding the impact of digital technologies on epistemology, methodology, and our professional identities as researchers, scholars, academics, and teachers. Our reading of this debate is that there is a tripartite relationship between the kind of work we should call DH (and aspire to produce), the nature of DH knowledge, research and scholarship (particularly regarding the role of artefacts produced), and issues of disciplinary orientation or professional identity. We could phrase these as the what, how, and who of DH and, of course, RtD. The discussion of our project is in no sense intended to provide an exclusive answer to those questions, but to give one snapshot of what DH and RtD may look like when they come together. We emphasize that this relationship can and will be productive for both disciplines and point to the lack of significant discussion hereto. © The Author 2016.

Modelling in digital humanities: Signs in context,31,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028757867&partnerID=40&md5=a6e86c894cd4f6fa5f22bcd909730d42,"In this paper we focus on modelling as a creative process to gain new knowledge about material and immaterial objects by generating and manipulating external representations of them. We aim at enriching the current theoretical understanding by contextualising digital humanities practices within a semiotic conceptualisation of modelling. A semiotic approach enables us to contextualise modelling in a scholarly framework well suited to humanistic enquiries, forcing us to investigate how models function as signs within specific contexts of production and use. Kralemann and Lattmann's semiotic model of modelling complemented by Elleström's theories on iconicity are some of the tools we use to inform this semiotic perspective on modelling. We contextualise Kralemann and Lattmann's theory within modelling practices in digital humanities by using three examples of models representing components and structure of historical artefacts. We show how their model of models can be used to understand and contextualise the models we study and how their classification of model types clarify important aspects of digital humanities modelling practice. © The Author 2016.

The impact of lacking metadata for the measurement of cultural and linguistic change using the Google Ngram data sets-Reconstructing the composition of the German corpus in times of WWII,30,10.1093/llc/fqv037,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028731873&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqv037&partnerID=40&md5=061b53de3c53b57593e4afbae2daae4d,"The Google Ngram Corpora seem to offer a unique opportunity to study linguistic and cultural change in quantitative terms. To avoid breaking any copyright laws, the data sets are not accompanied by any metadata regarding the texts the corpora consist of. Some of the consequences of this strategy are analyzed in this article. I chose the example of measuring censorship in Nazi Germany, which received widespread attention and was published in a paper that accompanied the release of the Google Ngram data (Michel et al. (2010): Quantitative analysis of culture using millions of digitized books. Science, 331(6014): 176-82). I show that without proper metadata, it is unclear whether the results actually reflect any kind of censorship at all. Collectively, the findings imply that observed changes in this period of time can only be linked directly to World War II to a certain extent. Therefore, instead of speaking about general linguistic or cultural change, it seems to be preferable to explicitly restrict the results to linguistic or cultural change 'as it is represented in the Google Ngram data'. On a more general level, the analysis demonstrates the importance of metadata, the availability of which is not just a nice add-on, but a powerful source of information for the digital humanities.",,,,,,,,,Koplenig A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a validated instrument, participants were divided into four groups based on their gaming preferences: (1) Well-rounded (WR) gamers, who play all types of games often; (2) Hardcore players, who frequently tend to play first-person shooter (FPS) and sports games; (3) Casual players, who play moderately and tend to play music, social, and puzzle games; and (4) Non-gamers, who barely play videogames at all. Among all of the participants' personal factors (age, gender, and type of player) that were measured, only gaming preferences seemed to have a significant (p<.05) positive influence on students' interest in theater-going. Neither age nor gender seemed to affect the outcomes. Casual and Well-rounded gamers scored higher in the game than Non-gamers and Hardcore players. Due to these results, we also explored whether the gaming profile affected traditional educational approaches. Traditional education worked better than videogames only for students who do not usually play videogames. This study suggests that gaming preferences may influence the effectiveness of different educational approaches. Knowing students' gaming preferences in advance may help educators find the best educational approach for each student. © 2017 IEEE.",applied games,Computer uses in education,computers and society,digital humanities,educational videogames,learning technologies,videogames on arts,,Manero B.,Torrente J.,Fernandez-Vara C.,Fernandez-Manjon B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the theory of deliberative communication as discussed within political science, political debates should be inclusive and stakeholders participating in these debates are required to justify their positions rationally and respectfully and should eventually defer to the better argument. The focus of the article is on the novel interactive visualizations that combine linguistic and statistical cues to analyze the deliberative quality of communication automatically. In particular, we quantify the degree of deliberation for four dimensions of communication: Participation, Respect, Argumentation and Justification, and Persuasiveness. Yet, these four dimensions have not been linked within a combined linguistic and visual framework, but each single dimension helps determining the degree of deliberation independently from each other. Since at its core, deliberation requires sustained and appropriate modes of communication, our main contribution is the automatic annotation and disambiguation of causal connectors and discourse particles.",,,,,,,,,Gold V.,El-Assady M.,Hautli-Janisz A.,Bögel T.,Rohrdantz C.,Butt M.,Holzinger K.,Keim D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It presents a case study that combines corpus analysis, automated geoparsing and geographic information systems (GIS) to investigate the geographies associated with some of the key aesthetic terms historically used in writing about the English Lake District: a culturally prestigious region of lakes and mountains in northwest England. The basis of this investigation is a corpus of travel writing and topographical literature about the Lake District containing more than 1.5 million words. The corpus mainly consists of works from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In investigating this corpus we identify and analyse a correspondence between eighteenth-century aesthetic theory and the use of the terms beautiful, picturesque, sublime and majestic in contemporaneous and later accounts of the Lakes region. Our analyses afford new insights into the historical use of these four aesthetic terms. Our findings, moreover, reveal how ephemeral publications, such as tourist guidebooks, helped to consolidate the application of the aesthetic principles and vocabulary formulated by canonical thinkers, including William Gilpin and Edmund Burke. In presenting this research, we demonstrate how a hybrid geographical and corpus-based methodology, which we call geographical text analysis, can advance the study of the connections between literature, aesthetics and physical geography. © 2017 The Authors",Corpus linguistics,Digital humanities,English Lake District,Geographic information systems (GIS),Landscape aesthetics,Picturesque,,,Donaldson C.,Gregory I.N.,Taylor J.E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are now important projects that map change in the American city along a number of dimensions, including zoning, suburbanization, commercial development, transportation infrastructure, and especially segregation. Most projects use their visual sources to illustrate the material consequences of the policies of powerful agencies and dominant planning ‘regimes.’ As useful as these projects are, they often inadvertently imbue their visualizations with an aura of inevitability, and thereby present political power as a kind of static substance–possess this and you can remake the city to serve your interests. A new project called ‘Imagined San Francisco’ is motivated by a desire to expand upon this approach, treating visual material not only to illustrate outcomes, but also to interrogate historical processes, and using maps, plans, drawings, and photographs not only to show what did happen, but also what might have happened. By enabling users to layer a series of historical urban plans–with a special emphasis on unrealized plans–‘Imagined San Francisco’ presents the city not only as a series of material changes, but also as a contingent process and a battleground for political power. © Edinburgh University Press 2017",cartography,Digital humanities,political regimes,San Francisco,urban planning,,,,Howell O.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perspectives of quantitative studies of the collection of novellas Novellenschatz,0,10.1007/s41244-017-0050-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018529908&doi=10.1007%2fs41244-017-0050-x&partnerID=40&md5=2a709cd6b97f3f153c3cc3252cd85d4c,"When the writers Paul Heyse and Hermann Kurz edited the collection of narrative texts published under the name Novellenschatz (treasure of novellas), in selecting the texts and writing the quite instructive introductions to the texts and the collection they were led by a notion of what a novella is. This essay analyses some aspects of this concept of novella. Starting with the discussion, whether the collection is representative for the German novellas of the 19th Century, three approaches are presented. First a method is presented which allows to determine models for authors in a collection spanning some time. Applying this method to the Novellenschatz yields the rather surprising result, that the romantic writer Eichendorff is the most influential writer of the corpus. Secondly, a definition of the novellas as having a clear-cut silhouette in comparison to the novel is tested using the character interactions modeled as a graph as proxy. The result shows that there really is a difference between the genres, at least the novellas in the collection and a collection of contemporary novels. Thirdly, using PCA on the hundred most frequent words it can be shown that one of the components is clearly different for the text by female authors in the collection, a closer analysis reveals that the texts by female authors have been selected based on the gender of the protagonist, while the selection of texts by male authors wasn't restricted by gender politics. © 2017 J.B.

Levels of annotating are: space, time, focalisation, reported speech, narrator's speech, relation of the speech of a character/of the narrator to a certain character, evaluative remarks, negation, figurative speech, ambiguity. Alongside with the tagset, guidelines for annotation will be developed in order to enable different persons to achieve consistent results (inter-annotator-agreement). In doing so, narratological models will be systematically reassessed and refined. The aim of this project is therefore to annotate about 100 short narratives. The corpus will render possible a great variety of follow-up aims and objectives. It permits systematic access to corpus segments annotated in the same way. Using Victor von Scheffel's Hugideo I demonstrate how complex a narratological annotation is.

The broader goal of our work and this paper is to address how we, as a team of emerging scholars, understand and investigate ‘cities’ in the current century as both networked at the global scale and dynamic places for everyday interactions and processes. The paradoxes and complexity inherent to understanding the ‘city’ and how to address these concerns led us to develop a framework that might enrich grounded urban theory through the ‘enabling constraints’ of place, technology and public. The productive character of these three concepts, combined with the practical constraints and interrelationships they bring to bear, allowed us to deepen our work and produced the context for our research of Northlake.

This method promises to empower scholars with a quantitative and data-driven tool to study culture and society, but its power has been limited by the use of data from books and simple analytics based essentially on word counts. This study addresses these problems by assembling a vast corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom, incorporating very fine-grained geographical and temporal information that is not available for books. The corpus spans 150 years and is formed by millions of articles, representing 14% of all British regional outlets of the period. Simple content analysis of this corpus allowed us to detect specific events, like wars, epidemics, coronations, or conclaves, with high accuracy, whereas the use of more refined techniques from artificial intelligence enabled us to move beyond counting words by detecting references to named entities. These techniques allowed us to observe both a systematic underrepresentation and a steady increase of women in the news during the 20th century and the change of geographic focus for various concepts. We also estimate the dates when electricity overtook steam and trains overtook horses as a means of transportation, both around the year 1900, along with observing other cultural transitions. We believe that these data-driven approaches can complement the traditional method of close reading in detecting trends of continuity and change in historical corpora. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

While Recogito 2 provides an online workspace for general-purpose document annotation, it is particularly well-suited for geo-annotation, in other words annotating documents with references to gazetteers, and supports the annotation of both texts and images (i.e., digitized maps).

The field of onomastics examines the linguistic roots and historical development of names, which have for the most part only standardized into single officially recognized forms since the late nineteenth century. Even slight spelling variations can introduce errors in geotagging techniques, and these differences in place-name spellings are thus vital considerations when seeking high rates of correct geospatial identification in historical texts. This article offers an overview of typical name-based variation that can cause issues in the accurate geotagging of any historical resource. The article argues that careful study and documentation of these variations can assist in the development of more complete onymic records, which in turn may inform geo-taggers through a cycle of variational recognition. It demonstrates how patterns in regional naming variation and development, across both specific and generic name elements, can be identified through the historical records of each known location. The article uses examples taken from a digitized corpus of writing about the English Lake District, a collection of 80 texts that date from between 1622 and 1900. Four of the more complex spelling-based problems encountered during the creation of a manual gazetteer for this corpus are examined. Specifically, the article demonstrates how and why such variation must be expected, particularly in the years preceding the standardization of place-name spellings. It suggests how procedural developments may be undertaken to account for such geo-referential issues in the Named Entity Recognition (NER) strategies employed by future projects. Similarly, the benefits of such multigenre corpora to assist in completing onomastic records is also shown via examples of new name forms discovered for prominent sites in the Lake District. This focus is accompanied by a discussion of the influence of literary works on place-name standardization—an aspect not typically accounted for in traditional onomastic study—to illustrate the extent to which authorial interests in regional toponymic histories can influence linguistic development. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © James O.

The first spanned her childhood through her years as first lady. The second recounted her tenure as secretary of state. Though both memoirs were written with a past orientation, they also sought to keep alive a future run for the presidency. Situating the two Clinton memoirs in the history of biography, we employ corpus rhetorical methods from the digital humanities to establish that Hard Choices featured a policy wonk identity compared to Living History’s more personal storyteller identity. This result is not surprising in light of the different segments of life each memoir covered. Adding surprise and insight is the discovery that both memoirs also feature additional Clinton identities that shed light on her strategies for a future presidential run and revealed the identity problems she faced as a woman vying for the presidency. © 2016 National Communication Association.",Campaign biographies,Hillary Clinton,Memoirs,Political identity,Presidential campaigns,,,,Kaufer D.S.,Parry-Giles S.J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The funders of a dh project described in this paper adhered to this positivistic assumption in their founding White Paper. They saw disciplines as blinders, best left behind in order to better see 'patterns'. However, positivism was not a real-world option for the social scientists, mathematicians, and information scientists engaged in this 'blue sky' project, which investigated digitized historical newspaper texts. Far from being a hindrance to their work, disciplinary traditions were central to any success they achieved. Instead of moving 'beyond' disciplines, they developed a pluralist, cross-disciplinary dialogue. Each participant contributed out of the epistemic convention that had proven fruitful in their discipline. The approach required an intellectual and emotional commitment to dialogue, and produced tantalizing rather than wholly satisfying results.

Motion capture-assisted gesture research. On the relevance of the theory of notation in digital humanities,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057758441&partnerID=40&md5=48a98c9f76461ea29ebe44915a6abb22,"During the last decade, and especially with the rise of the Digital Humanities, computer-assisted methods for gathering and analysing data have increasingly found their way into the humanities, which were traditionally oriented towards hermeneutics. Data elicitation and analysis are usually linked with quantitative research methods, but they are also connected with the construction of scientific models; they can be regarded as a transcription process that is involved in constituting the respective object of research. In this article, we study the use of motion capture technology for gesture research, in order to show more generally how theoretical modelling is connected with the process that we employed to ""capture"" co-speech gesture. A semiotic analysis is used to investigate the epistemological status of such data models, as well as the sign processes that determine this status. As a theoretical instrument for the analysis of these computer-assisted processes of modelling and transcription, we apply Nelson Goodman's theory of notation, which provides clear syntactic and semantic criteria for describing digital, notational, and analogue symbol systems. As a further approach, Ludwig Jäger's theory of transcription is used to highlight how computer-based modelling techniques constitute the objects of investigation in the humanities. The article asks the following questions: What exactly are we recording when we use digital computer technology to capture human motion? Which criteria can be used to model these semiotic processes? What advantages does motion capture give us, and does it really offer new perspectives in comparison with other techniques such as traditional video recordings? In conclusion, this contribution argues for a semiotic foundation for the digital humanities and comparable approaches in the social sciences. © 2017 Stauffenburg Verlag.

Again and again it is suggested that the DH face new challenges that will require new methods, tools and bridges between disciplines. It is less frequently acknowledged that DH are not the only initiative to face such a task. Indeed, models for integration across disciplines on the practical as well as the theoretical level are present in other endeavors as well. In particular, this article illustrates the relevance for DH of results of both a practical and a theoretical nature from multimodal semiotics.

Diagrammatic thinking tools in digital humanities - Approach to a semiotic foundation,2,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057725970&partnerID=40&md5=822575e6c7a1276abc79fbc632c32e8d,"The article uses examples of synchronoptic views of timelines, diagrams of historical narratives about complex interrelations and cognitive maps to show how the generation of an explanatory hypotheses by abductive reasoning supported by means of interactive information visualization tools and, more generally, how the application of such diagrammatic thinking tools in order to create new insights in the Humanities can be explained semiotically. Thus, the article demonstrates how semiotics can make a theoretical contribution to the Digital Humanities, both on its Computer Science side as well as on its Humanities side. Formal modeling as the core of the Digital Humanities is a necessary precondition for the automatic processing of humanistic research activities. This concerns both the algorithmic and the technical level of the informational implementation as well as the computational level of the diagrammatic representation. A semiotic explanation can concentrate on the computational level, without having to go into the algorithmic and technical details of the implementation. A semiotic theory of Digital Humanities may therefore focus on the analysis of diagrammatic thinking tools to support and extend humanities research in terms of an augmenting human(ist) intellect approach. © 2017 Stauffenburg Verlag.

Saved games and respawn timers: The dilemma of representing death in video games,3,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052025248&partnerID=40&md5=c41b56bdcf12fc1f2822c16d4644f403,"Beginning with the late 20th century, video games have been studied as cultural artefacts that are both influenced by and influential towards the societies that produce and receive them. Like other cultural productions, video games are partly concerned with representation. Even though it might seem that the often fantastic worlds they generate have little to do with what would be referred to as “the real world,” many of the great questions of human literature and arts are nevertheless present. Death is no exception, but unlike other themes, its depiction has always presented video game producers with a certain dilemma. How might one properly render the sense of loss associated with death, for example, when one must also offer the player the possibility to turn back in time and resume their gameplay as if the event had never taken place? Indeed, when the only consequence of death consists in a temporary removal from the game world, followed by an almost immediate reintegration, how meaningful might the event be? Furthermore, considering that a number of scholars define video games as series of rules and obstacles to be overcome, death being nothing more than one such obstacle, can mortality be at all represented in this novel media? The aim of the present paper is to explore the conflicting relation between the representation of death in video games and basic game mechanics, as well as to examine some notable titles and their attempts to render death more faithfully. Ultimately, we question what remains of death and its “traditional” connotations when placed in the relatively new media of video games. © 2017 Universitatae din Bucuresti.

On the definition and periodisation of digital literature,7,10.22601/pet.2017.02.08,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85051831668&doi=10.22601%2fpet.2017.02.08&partnerID=40&md5=56cc169b96b5eb8f5785cfb6756bc51d,"The article examines the links between digital literature and digital humanities, as well as various definitions and periodisation of digital literature. Digital literature is ‘digitally born’ literature, created and studied since the end of the 1980s and largely defined as a work with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by computer technology (e.g. hypertext literature, multimedia poetry, interactive literature, etc.). In the periodisation of digital literature, two generations have so far been differentiated (late 1980s until 1995 and from 1995 until today). The article adds a third generation to this periodisation, starting from 2006–2007 and linked with the development and spread of social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr) and smart gadgets. The article defines the third generation of digital literature as literature created via social media (including socalled Alt Lit literature), characterised by its democracy, dialogue between participants, textual and narrative dynamics, and mixing of various forms of media. In addition, it is suggested that this type of literature can be associated with postpostmodernist literary trends. A closer look is taken at the work of Estonian authors Kaur Riismaa, Liina Tammiste and Keiti Vilms, who have all used social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter). The article discusses whether these authors can be associated with the term ‘Alt Lit’. The conclusion reached is that several of the features of Alt Lit can be ascribed to the texts and activity of Riismaa, Tammiste and Vilms; Alt Lit features seem to correspond best to Vilms. The overall conclusion of the article is, however, that the content and essence of digital literature does not so much depend on the will of the authors, creative impulses or innerliterature movements, but instead on the development of computer technology. Thus the definitions of digital literature are dynamic in time and depend on the technological solutions that are emerging in a given period and the types and works of digital literature these new technologies can inspire. © 2017 Tallinn University.

These are, in particular, the creation of kinetic figures (adjection, detraction, permutation, atomization), alternative narrations; the construction of a plot on the level of representation; the creation of textual meanings in the interaction of the semantics of the word as a graphic-sonoric sign and as an arbitrary sign.

The paper first introduces some of the technical aspects in creating a real-time monitor corpus that grows every day, and then two case studies illustrate how the corpus could be used as empirical evidence in studies focusing on the global spread of English. Our approach in the case studies is sociolinguistic, and we are interested in how widespread multilingualism which involves English is in the region, and what happens to ongoing grammatical change in digital environments. The results are based on 6.6 million tweets collected during the first four months of data streaming. They show that English was the most frequently used language, accounting for almost a third. This indicates that Nordic Twitter users choose English as a means of reaching wider audiences. The preference for English is the strongest in Denmark and the weakest in Finland. Tweeting mostly occurs late in the evening, and high-profile media events such as the Eurovision Song Contest produce considerable peaks in Twitter activity. The prevalent use of informal features such as univerbated verb forms (e.g., gotta for (HAVE) got to) supports previous findings of the speech-like nature of written Twitter data, but the results indicate that tweeters are pushing the limits even further. © J.UCS.",Corpus linguistics,Language choice,Oral discourse style,Twitter,,,,,Laitinen M.,Lundberg J.,Levin M.,Lakaw A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the radio service has also been disliked and accused of playing the same artists over and over. We decided to set up an experiment with the purpose to explore the possible limitations found within ""infinite archives"" of music streaming services. Our hypothesis was that Spotify Radio appears to consist of an infinite series of songs. It claims to be personalised and never-ending, yet music seems to be delivered in limited loop patterns. What would such loop patterns look like? Are Spotify Radio's music loops finite or infinite? How many tracks (or steps) does a normal loop consist of? To answer these research questions, at Umeå University's digital humanities hub, Humlab, we set up an intervention using 160 bot listeners. Our bots were all Spotify Free users. They literally had no track record and were programmed to listen to different Swedish music from the 1970s. All bots were to document all subsequent tracks played in the radio loop and (inter)act within the Spotify Web client as an obedient bot listener, a liker, a disliker, and a skipper. The article describes different research strategies when dealing with proprietary data. Foremost, however, it empirically recounts the radio looping interventions set up at Humlab. Essentially, the article suggests a set of methodologies for performing humanist inquiry on big data and black-boxed media services that increasingly provide key delivery mechanisms for cultural materials. Spotify serves as a case in point, yet principally any other platform or service could be studied in similar ways. Using bots as research informants can be deployed within a range of different digital scholarship, so this article appeals not only to media or software studies scholars, but also to digitally inclined cultural studies such as the digital humanities.",Bot intervention,Digital methods,Music looping,Reverse engineering,Spotify radio,,,,Snickars P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jockers, Laura Mandell, Ryan Heuser, Long Le-Khac, and Joanna Swafford, this paper provides a twofold explanation to the field's failure to produce “great results.” Both explanations relate to “validation,” the process by which quantitative results are shown to be reliable and trustworthy. Many distant reading projects have produced disappointing results because they have been more interested in validating their tools—showing that their computational methods are able to confirm existing stereotypes—than in pursuing genuine discoveries. Many others, meanwhile, produce provocative results that cannot be meaningfully validated. Although the double bind of validation is real, I propose collaboration and “interdisciplinary adaptation” as promising solutions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,,,Hammond A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decadent literature and art have always had their adherents, but from the mid-1980s, the growing influence of feminism and other forms of gendered reading, notably queer theory, began to transform their scholarly understanding. Rather than simply being concerned with artistic autonomy and despising the vulgar herd, decadents such as Oscar Wilde raised questions of subjectivity and identity, which would become increasingly important as the 20th century unfolded. Critics also began to revise the decadent “canon,” recognising the importance of women writers and extended its boundaries beyond 1895 or 1914, the two informally accepted markers of the movement's end. The essay discusses key books and writers on decadence, briefly considers the importance of digital humanities in decadent scholarship and posits some future directions, which critical writing on decadence may pursue. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,,,,,,,Freeman N.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Women Writers Project has dedicated significant effort over the past thirty years to creating what Christoph Schöch calls “smart clean data”: a moderate-sized collection of early modern women’s writing, carefully transcribed and corrected, with detailed digital text encoding that has evolved in response to research and changing standards for text representation. But that data —whether considered as a publication through Women Writers Online, or as a proof of the viability of text encoding approaches like those expressed in the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines— is only the most visible part of a much larger ecology. That ecology includes complex human systems, evolving sets of tools, and a massive apparatus of documentation and organizational memory that have made it possible for the project to work coherently over such a long period of time.

Mainly, Poetriae aims at building a digital library of Medieval and Golden Age Castilian poetry treatises. It will create digital editions for them, by philologically marking up each metrical and poetic concept in an unambiguous way, in order to allow treatises to be retrievable not just by bibliographic metadata, but also by key concepts, such as poetic genre, stanza types, rhyme, etc. The project also intends to enable automatic analysis and visualizations of such data. Design and application of specific vocabularies for poetry and metrics are the basis for the whole project. Metadata standards for thesaurus and markup (XML-TEI) will be applied. This platform will be fed on previous highly recognized critical editions, enriched with metrical concepts from a controlled vocabulary or thesaurus, with categorised and unambiguous metrical concepts. Advantages: data visualisation, same-concept collation across various texts; even metric theory comparison for Medieval and Golden Age poems.

Most importantly, annotated content can help users obtain a deeper and broader understanding of a text compared to digital content without annotations. This work proposes a novel collaborative annotation system (CAS) with four types of multimedia annotations including text annotation, picture annotation, voice annotation and video annotation which can embedded into any HTML Web pages to enable users to collaboratively add and manage annotations on these pages and provide a shared mechanism for discussing shared annotations among multiple users. By applying the CAS in a mashup on static HTML Web pages, this study aims to discuss the applications of CAS in digital curation, crowdsourcing and digital humanities to encourage existing strong relations among them. Design/methodology/approach-This work adopted asynchronous JavaScript (Ajax) and a model-viewcontroller framework to implement a CAS with reading annotation tools for knowledge creating, archiving and sharing services, as well as applying the implemented CAS to support digital curation, crowdsourcing and digital humanities. A questionnaire survey method was used to investigate the ideas and satisfaction of visitors who attended a digital curation with CAS support in the item dimensions of the interactivity with displayed products, the attraction and the content absorption effect. Also, to collect qualitative data that may not be revealed by the questionnaire survey, semi-structured interviews were performed at the end of the digital curation exhibition activity. Additionally, the effects of the crowdsourcing and digital humanities with CAS support on collecting and organizing ideas and opinions for historical events and promoting humanity research outcomes were considered as future works because they all need to take a long time to investigate. Findings-Based on the questionnaire survey, this work found that the digital curation with CAS support revealed the highest rating score in terms of the item dimension of attraction effect. The result shows applying CAS to support digital curation is practicable, novel and interesting to visitors. Additionally, this work also successfully applied the developed CAS to crowdsourcing and digital humanities so that the two research fields may be brought into a new ground. Originality/value-Based on the CAS, this work developed a novel digital curation approach which has a high degree of satisfaction on attraction effect to visitors, an innovative crowdsourcing platform that combined with a digital archive system to efficiently gather collective intelligence to solve the difficult problems of identifying digital archive contents and a high potential digital humanity research mode that can assist humanities scholars to annotate the texts with distinct interpretation and viewpoints on an ancient map, as well as discuss with other humanities scholars to stimulate discussion onmore issues. © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Collaborative annotation systems,Crowdsourcing,Digital curation,Digital humanities,,,,,Chen C.-M.,Tsay M.-Y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also looks at Omeka’s major features through a theoretical lens of exhibit orientation that provides another way to assess it as a digital content tool. Design/methodology/approach: The case study method was selected to review four comparable exhibits from the same institution. The Omeka software was evaluated through a lens of exhibit design that includes two orientations (object vs information) and multiple goals (object identification and display, engagement, interpretation and education). Findings: Omeka is a valuable tool for digital exhibits because of its strength in knowledge representation through a standard metadata scheme, the ability to group items that have some aspect in common such as author or topic, and its support of narrative exhibits incorporating text and images. Omeka needs some additional support, however, to fulfill more complex goals such as user engagement, object interpretation and user education. Originality/value: The paper grounds the examination of Omeka within a theoretical framework of exhibit orientation that enriches its observations and conclusions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Content management systems,Digital humanities,Digital libraries,Exhibits,Omeka,Visualizations,,,Marsh E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is achieved by encoding the texts following the guidelines set forth by the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI). Design/methodology/approach: This paper explains what text encoding is and why following the guidelines set forth by the TEI Consortium was the best choice for the Rosarium Project. It then goes on to outline the workflow and choices made by the principal researcher which are needed to move the project steadily forward. Findings: The principal researcher on the Rosarium Project has found that encoding with the TEI was easy to learn and fun to do, as well as intellectually stimulating. Librarians should find text-encoding projects of their own specialist subjects equally doable. Originality/value: The Rosarium Project is unique, in that it is curating early twentieth century articles on the subject of roses that appeared in popular magazines. These materials are hidden away in online repositories and libraries worldwide. This project is of value, in that it provides primary sources to researchers in areas of popular culture, horticulture and garden history and also acts as an example of what librarians can contribute to the Digital Humanities. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Digital collections,Digital humanities,Roses,Special collections,TEI,Text encoding,,,Tryon J.R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: The approach compares two case studies of how digitization of legacy oral history collections was carried out. The paper discusses these projects utilizing a lifecycle model approach and reveals how archival and digital humanities perspectives drove some of the projects’ differences. Findings: The authors find that when working with digitizing legacy oral history collections, each collection will require different approaches and methods of problem solving. In large institutions with multiple repositories, it can be useful for project teams to consult each other to develop best practices. Practical implications: The two case studies presented in this paper can serve as models for other institutions digitizing many oral history collections and serve as a model for communication and collaboration in larger institutions with multiple repositories. Originality/value: This paper compares and contrasts two case studies of digitization projects involving legacy oral history collections in different units of one large institution. Project teams were influenced by different approaches. One project was conducted by archivists and the other led by a digital humanities librarian. Differing professional foci provided different perspectives about collection characteristics and, subsequently, led to different approaches that impacted implementation of the projects. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Academic libraries,Archives,Audiovisual materials,Digital humanities,Digitization,Oral history,,,White K.,Radick C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If our interaction with primary sources in the history of linguistics increasingly occurs digitally, and if representations of data always encode a particular point of view, how can we go about decoupling our analysis of such sources from the digital resources that mediate it? What recuperative processes might allow the researcher to reintegrate, or recapture, what gets lost in a digital format? In this paper I suggest that the digital frameworks we use to represent primary sources in the history of linguistics benefit from being submitted to a critical reading as much as the sources themselves.

It will probe some of the possibilities and limits of the computer interface as a reading and research tool by unpacking theoretical and practical aspects of interface design. Design/methodology/approach: The authors wanted to see if they could design a tool that would meet three interrelated goals: the first was to develop a digital tool that would enable scholarship rather than mere publishing. Next, they wanted to build an interface that would acknowledge the situatedness of reading and meaning-making practices. Findings: The research-oriented design approach to interface design has shown us how valuable it is to combine research and practice when thinking through issues in the digital humanities. Engaging in such a design project provides the unique opportunity to bring together theoretical concepts relating interface design with robust tools like XML mark-up and Drupal modules.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents the testing, the lessons learned and how those lessons informed the subsequent redesign of the site. Findings: Results imply that a majority of users, even digital humanists, were not looking for a unique and specialised interface, but assumed – and preferred – a user experience that reflects common search systems. Although the audience for digital humanities sites is becoming increasingly diverse, the needs of the different user groups may be more similar than had previously been assumed. Research limitations/implications: The usability test employed 11 participants, five of whom were coded as “general public”. Four of these five had previously volunteered to transcribe and upload letters. This meant that they were already familiar with the project and with the Letters of 1916 Transcription Desk. However, their prior involvement was a result of their genuine interest in the site, thus ensuring that their interactions during testing were more realistic. Practical implications: The lesson learned may be useful for the Digital Editions of future crowdsourced humanities projects.

The digital library is based on a knowledge base storing knowledge on the primary sources that Dante refers to in his works, i.e. the works of other authors Dante refers to in his texts. At present, this information is scattered on many paper books, making it difficult to systematically overview the cultural background of Dante and to obtain a well-founded perception of how this background was gradually set up in time. The same applies also to other authors, therefore the applicability of our work extends well beyond the specific author we are considering in our project. The digital library that we are building is based on an ontology for representing the knowledge on one author's works and on the primary sources embedded in the commentaries to these works. Following this approach, a semantic network of Dante's works and of references to primary sources of these works was created. Furthermore, a web application allowing users to explore the semantic network in various ways and to visualize statistical information about the references as charts and tables was developed. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

Jonson’s ‘virtual’ journey was to enhance public engagement, his absorption into new communities echoed by exchanges with their twenty-first-century inhabitants. Simultaneously, the tweets suggested the spatial-temporality of Jonson’s actions in a manner not discernable in the linear narrative, revealing their kinetic quality.

Specifically, how are the expressive properties of scriptural markings reshaped and recast when conveyed and received through modes of viewing and interaction afforded by digital rather than printed spaces? Virtual-literary works such as New Word Order: Basra (2003) and Dear Esther (2012) raise just these questions, which have significant implications for conceptualising the literary experience within a digital context. This article develops a response to these issues by concentrating less on the technical differences between printed and digital media and focusing instead on how their expressive potential is actualised within the space of the interpretative encounter. It presents a model, derived from work in the sociology of science and the digital humanities, in which the literary is understood as emerging from a performative matrix of intersecting actors, materials, and processes in real time - of which the medium is one component. From this standpoint, the significance of the virtual-literary encounter is that it represents an extension of these performative vectors into comparatively novel digital contexts, enabling different narrative, thematic, and semantic aspects to be crystallised in relation to alternative technocultural developments. Such encounters are countertextual in demonstrating the potentialities of literary expression beyond the naturalised spaces of print - a reframing rather than a superseding of the literary. © 2016 Edinburgh University Press.

Accordingly, it may be argued that the model of the collaborative project-based edition need only to be extended, to become 'social'. This article questions that thesis, demonstrating the problems that can arise with collaborative projects applying digital methodologies to scholarly work through analysis of the Shakespeare Quartos and the European Virtual Museum Transnational Network projects and arguing that the term 'collaboration' needs critical examination. Indeed, to the extent that 'collaboration' may be closed, and may serve narrow scholarly purposes, it can be the antithesis of 'social'. In place of project-based collaboration, this essay proposes that we see 'social' editions as grounded in communities, not in collaboration, and that the principle upon which they should be built is (following Shirky) 'design for generosity'. This implies a different role for the editors and scholars from the academy: rather than the leaders of collaborations, we may become key participants in, and enablers of, communities.

As classical geography was not only a graphic representation of the world, but a multi‐layered cultural system based on specific notions and concepts, it is now necessary to go beyond the taxonomy of place‐names and their visualization on modern maps. The interpretation of ancient geography as a ‘mental model’ implies the importance of different and complementary aspects which should be addressed systematically: the expression of distances, the language of spatial orientation, the definition of environmental landmarks. For each of these aspects an integrated digital methodology is proposed, either implementing existing infrastructures or focusing on new strategies.

Out of the hypotheses we explored, bilingualism, linguistic similarity of languages, and shared religion provide the best explanations for the similarity of interests between cultural communities. Population attraction and geographical proximity are also significant, but much weaker factors bringing communities together. In addition, we present an approach that allows for extracting significant cultural borders from editing activity of Wikipedia users, and comparing a set of hypotheses about the social mechanisms generating these borders. Our study sheds light on how culture is reflected in the collective process of archiving knowledge on Wikipedia, and demonstrates that cross-lingual interconnections on Wikipedia are not dominated by one powerful language.

The payoffs can be seen in the matter of data storage and data query but these tools also raise the question of the prosopographical practices inherited from the scholar tradition. In particular, a relational database enables us to examine the way to build a prosopography from a new point of view. This examination is all the more needed in the context of Attic prosopography, whilst our corpus of sources is incomplete and based on texts established with difficulty. Neither methodological questions, nor the questioning about the validity of the prosopographical data, on which depend many studies, are new. This methodological questioning is nevertheless renewed when we try to translate the prosopographical logic into the relational databases system. The first part of this paper is a historiographical analysis of the long tradition of Attic prosopography so as to understand why the methodological discourse remains implicit since the end of the 19th century. It seems that the historians of Ancient Greece intervene less than those of the Roman world in the epistemological debate, even if prosopography was born at the same time, within the scope of Greek and Roman epigraphical studies. This link with epigraphy remains so important that it is difficult to distinguish between the different kinds of prosopography (onomasticon, epigraphical commentary, social enquiry) when we look back to the publications dealing with Hellenistic Athens for example. In these studies, we can see that making prosopography seems to be obvious when you work with Attic inscriptions. This is maybe the reason why the method used to build the personal lexicon is not systematically explained. Notwithstanding, we can find reflections about methodological considerations in several of those publications. The second part of this article aims to demonstrate that a relational database reveals this implicit discourse. After having explained how a database devoted to Attic prosopography should be structured, I illustrate with a precise example the link between the methodological discourse and this specific data structure. Namely, the recording of data in separate tables can stress a set of arguments usually used to read incomplete names in texts, decipher homonyms and find parents. It would be of great benefit if we decided on the permanent combination of arguments sufficient to accept a prosopographical hypothesis as certain. We must first determine each kind of arguments we are used to taking in consideration, such as sharing of demotic or onomastic network. We also must establish if we have to give them the same value. We must finally decide how many of these arguments should be chosen together in the same rationale.

Investigation of such an object discloses the perspectives on construction of the generalized model of mind and can help to build the bridge between traditional and digital humanities. The subject of traditional humanities is natural human activity; the subject of digital humanities is computer-based forms of activity and communication. Finding signs created not only by human but also by natural circumstances helps to define the sign system that unites the natural (non-anthropogenic) and artificial kinds of mind. Methodology of research includes the principles of semiotics previously developed by Charles Peirce and Ferdinand de Saussure and expanded by Yuri Lotman and Boris Uspensky. Semiotic interpretation of mind as the object of culture allows the building of a generalized model of mind as one of textual constructions, presenting the history of mankind as the replacement of natural events by secondary models. The author concludes that the revealing of a generalized model of mind opens new opportunities for the construction of the intelligent activity strictly interpreted as special sign systems. Semiotic studies interpret culture as a rationality making machine, and activity of mind is caused by the work of such a machine. Because of that, if traditional meaning sign systems were estimated as human-made kinds of complex of primary signs, then modern statements help to see the absence of an irresistible limit to interpret such complex as a nature-made but non-anthropogenic phenomenon. © 2016 by De Gruyter Mouton 2016.",digital humanities,general model of mind,naturalistic position,philosophy of mind,semiotics,traditional humanities,,,Kulikov S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study takes the opposite approach. Ignoring the meaning of the text (at first), it tries to detect the compositional structure of the Yasna ceremony by concentrating on formal matters such as specific closing sections, frames, etc. In a second step, the content is considered in order to offer interpretations for the compositional structure. In ReAF I (Jügel 2015), information on the technical and theoretical background of the tool ""Repetition Analysis Function"" (ReAF) was given and textual units were identified. In ReAF II, the results of the ReAF for the Yasna ceremony as it appears in the manuscript J2 will be presented in detail. Furthermore, I will offer an interpretation of how to transfer the structural results to an analysis of the compositional structure of the Yasna.

On the other hand, some systems are more user-friendly, but present basic analyses and are limited to the needs of a specific research community. In order to overcome the aforementioned limitations, we developed ALCIDE (Analysis of Language and Content In a Digital Environment), a web-based platform designed to assist humanities scholars in navigating and analysing large quantities of textual data such as historical sources and literary works. This suite of tools combines advanced text processing techniques with intuitive visualisations of the output to serve a broad range of research questions, which no other comparable tool can address in a single platform.

Drawing on conceptual work being undertaken at the Western Sydney University in order to further develop and extend the widely respected ‘French Book Trade in Enlightenment Europe’ (FBTEE) database project, it explores how historians might proceed to correlate, map, and analyse multiple spatially referenced data sets pertaining to the creation, publication, dissemination, ownership, consumption, reception, policing, and geographic setting of texts. While the authors recognise the many dangers and limitations inherent in reducing the cultural history of text to a set of statistical data, they observe that historians frequently use the production and circulation of texts as a useful proxy for understanding the circulation of ideas. Hence historical bibliometrics can provide measurable indicators of cultural resonance. The challenge, then, is to meaningfully integrate algorithmic abstractions with qualitative-based humanities research.

It discusses the character of information derived from the object and other related sources, to outline possibilities for media-historical research connecting multiple collections to create large sets of data. The aim of this article is twofold: first, I share practical knowledge about identifying lantern slides of commercially distributed slide sets, to generalise an understanding of identification and evaluation from both an archival and a scholarly perspective. Combined documentation of information from various sources (catalogues, lantern slides, trade press, lecture material, readings, related media) is often necessary to correctly identify lantern slides. Second, I propose criteria for research infrastructures to incorporate data documentation towards comparative research designs. The enormous dispersion of lantern slides over many collections leads scholars to build their own corpora from objects held in various collections, which can be ameliorated with standardised descriptors across collections. Further, new research questions tracing synchronic and diachronic dispersion could be asked with the collaborative documentation of a larger set of data, for example, assessing the geographic distribution and popularity of slide sets, reconstructing trade networks or the migration of images across various media forms. Altogether, collaborative documentation and search could lead to knowledge about the formation of canons of shared visual knowledge. Research into the dissemination of slide sets and the popularity of displayed motifs cannot be restricted to either ‘distant readings’ or ‘close readings’ exclusively, and benefits from the ability to switch between close inspections of the object as well as networked sources. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Digital humanities,documentation of archival objects,magic lantern slides,,,,,,Dellmann S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kurokawa designed it as a living organism that conglomerates a number of flexible removable capsules into one single living entity. In terms of human existences within postmodernity, Anne Burdick notes, ""erasure and forgetting will become as important to the horizons of humanistic work as preservation and remembering"" in her collaborative work Digital Humanities. In the ideal world of postmodernity, not only can memories be deleted and restored simultaneously but also recycled just as Capsule Tower was built to be erased and forgotten. Such premeditated disposability makes Capsule Tower sustainable, and it contains both the old and the new in order to create a labyrinthine assemblage that perennially welcomes any innovation as well as outward intrusion. In this way, Capsule Tower actualizes the sustainable symbiosis of human and machine as it mobilizes its inhabitants into replaceable nomads, who are encapsulated in a colossal piece of sustainable furniture. Therefore, Nakagin Capsule Tower is an incarnate of posthuman sublime as well as a Leibnizian being that recognizes the whole within each part-it encompasses all without devouring. © Common Ground Publishing, Chia-wen Kuo, All Rights Reserved.",Nakagin capsule tower,Posthumanism and metabolism movement in japan,Sustainable architecture,,,,,,Kuo C.-W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century bard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited comparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in literature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous literary controversies of all time, coloring the reception of the poetry to this day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while others protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological sources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian, initiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the two-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the poems in 1765. Here, we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of view. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described in the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources. Despite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric epics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant network-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer. They also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the narratives known as Acallam na Senórach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",digital humanities,James Macpherson,literature,Networks,Ossian,,,,Yose J.,Kenna R.,Maccarron P.,Platini T.,Tonra J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, although videogames are frequently cloned by rival videogame developers, copyright law appears ill-equipped to cope with the practice. Cloners avoid copying the game components that are clearly protected by copyright: the frames, sounds, or computer code; instead, they copy the way in which the videogame plays (“the gameplay”) which courts have found to be outside the scope of copyright protection. Some scholars have argued that the cloners would be more vulnerable to effective legal challenge if videogames were protected as a new category of works in copyright law. In this article, however, I draw upon videogame theory from the digital humanities, and link this to the concept of copyright harmonisation, which has been propounded as likely to guide future decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, to explain why the suggestion that videogames should comprise a new category of copyright works is not practicable. Instead, I argue that a videogame as an entity should be protected by copyright, as should any other creative work, provided it meets the criteria of “an original intellectual creation”. © 2016 Susan Corbett",Category of copyright works,Cloning,Copyright,Videogame,,,,,Corbett S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A consideration of framing devices can also further our understanding of digital resources: much as print agents mediated printed books, digital humanists help reinforce the value of new technologies for the study of early modern texts, guiding users to apply new methods of research, and helping establish new areas of scholarship. As a new kind of print agent, digital humanists must be more aware of their choices in curating, organising and labeling metadata.

Building management systems (BMS) are critical in operating any modern commercial building, deconstructing space and reconstructing it out of manageable assets. I will demonstrate through a case study how this process of de/reconstruction can render the intention of a space uncertain. Deleuze’s ‘assemblage’ theory is used as a potential model of how space is conceived as a conglomeration of things. I draw from a number of theorists, including Lefebvre and Coyne to explore the problematic of how space is quantified, constructed and interpreted, analysing the effect of BMS on spatial production. Ultimately, I offer a methodology developed through original research that sheds light on how space might be reclaimed from these systems. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",digital humanities,Mobile technology,space management,spatial practice,,,,,McMeel D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In reinventing the dual demands of memory and migration in the postmodern society, The Sun King recognises and pursues alternative poetic possibilities. The article suggests that O’Callaghan’s Twitter-poem “The Pearl Works” can be read as indicative of an expansive impulse towards ephemeral online works.

The results of our data experiment highlighted current problems related citation indices and the way that books are recorded by different citing authors. Our research further demonstrates the primary problem of matching book titles as ‘cited objects’ with book titles held in a union library catalog, given that books are always recorded distinctly in libraries if published as separate editions with different International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs). Due to various ‘matching’ problems related to the ISBN, we suggest a new type of identifier, a ‘Book Object Identifier’, which would allow bibliometricians to recognize a book published in multiple formats and editions as ‘one object’ suitable for evaluation.

CLARIN infrastructure makes it possible to carry out e-Humanities type research by combining datasets from distinct disciplines through tools for data processing. The outcome of the CLARIN-NL COAVA-project (acronym of: Cognition, Acquisition and Variation tool) allows researchers to access two datasets from two different sub disciplines simultaneously, namely Dutch first child language acquisition files located in Childes (MacWhinney, 2000) and historical Dutch Dialect Dictionaries through the development of a tool for easy exploration of nouns. © 2015 The Authors",Child language acquisition,CLARIN infrastructure,Corpus linguistics,Dialectal lexicography,Digital tools,Lexical variation,,,Cornips L.,Swanenberg J.,Heeringa W.,de Vriend F.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach – The participant observer method was used to collect experiential evidence while applying the tools to a collection of text-, image-, and video-based digital cultural records. Findings – TAMS Analyzer was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for those with coding and qualitative data analysis experience. Those with general experience will be able to create datasets with the support of manuals and tutorials, while those with limited experience may find it difficult to use. Viewshare was found to be a low barrier to entry tool for sharing data online, and accessible for all skill levels. Research limitations/implications – TAMS Analyzer supports Mac and Linux platforms only, so a low-cost software recommendation was made for those in Windows environments. Practical implications – Librarians can use these tools to address data access gaps while promoting library digital collections. Social implications – With a greater understanding of data tools, librarians can be advisors, collaborators, agents for data culture, and relevant participants in digital humanities scholarship. Originality/value – The research evaluates both the capabilities of the tools and the barriers to using or accessing them, which are often neglected. The paper addresses a need in the literature for greater scrutiny of tools that are a critical component of the data ecology, and will further assist librarians when connecting scholars to tools of inquiry in an environment with limited funding and technical support. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Academic libraries,Data,Data services,Digital humanities,Digital libraries,Qualitative research,,,Rath L.L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to supplement the broad picture of how digital archives are searched. Online search log data were collected on-the-fly from humanities scholars in Macau. Their search behavior including search queries, highlights, and annotations to texts was analyzed with data mining algorithms to detect their actual search behavior pattern. In addition, hardcopy survey and individual interviews were conducted to make greater sense of their search behavior.

It marks the shift from outward expansion to passive defense, whereas underground marine trades were rampant and China had to face the rising Western powers. It deserves to examine Ming's maritime management by different perspectives including the coastal islands. This research focuses on Veritable Records of the Ming(明實錄) and explores key terms such as ‘island’(島) and ‘isle’(嶼) via the approach of ‘Digital Humanities’ to sum up the main issues of islands governing in early Ming Dynasty: 1. To subjugate political rivals on the sea and to defeat remnant Mongolian militaries. 2. To surrender rebels and appease refugees on the coastal islands. 3. To suppress and defend against Japanese pirates. 4. Diplomatic relations with neighboring countries. These issues reflected that Chinese dynastic regime transition from Yuan to Ming not only drastically altered the order of the East Asia seas after 14th c., but was also the key factor for the island governing policies in the early Ming period.

The initiative responds to a growing need for museum and archive professionals to work with artists in documenting their production methods, and building knowledge for future treatment and re-activation of their work. The first undertaking of the Artist Archives Project is to create an information resource devoted to the multidisciplinary artist/activist David Wojnarowicz. Project researchers are working in conjunction with curators at the Whitney Museum of American Art who are preparing for a Wojnarowicz exhibition, along with others familiar with his work. Since the artist is deceased, most of the information comes from archives, publications, and interviews with people who knew and worked with him. The project takes a digital humanities approach by assigning equal emphasis to the content and the database/web portal design. The resource contains technical and historical information about the artist's films, video, photography, paintings, drawings, and performance work. The research team creates transcripts from interviews, annotated guides to other resources, and information regarding the challenges of exhibiting and conserving his work. In addition to artist-specific resources, the project aims to stimulate discussion on topics that underlie curating and conserving contemporary art, including authorship, authenticity, and the ethical responsibilities of curators and conservators.

In this light, technologycentred narratives should be complemented by an intellectual history of technology-related «myths and dystopias», in order to increase our understanding of how digital technologies are presented in the disciplinary and public debates. Whereas this type of analysis has taken its start from library science and the digital humanities, however, it is still in its infancy within the field of museum computing. To this purpose, the article provides an interpretive and critical review of the debate on the automated cataloguing and digitization of museum collections. It highlights a sequence of discursive shifts in time since the 1960s to the present decade are identified and discussed: namely, a phase of «standardization», followed by «the museum of the Information Society» and, most recently, a «post-modernist utopia» which dominates the current debate. Each new paradigm tends at the same time to reverse and «re-mediate» some characteristics of former phases, generating controversies that are likely to proceed until more empirical knowledge is collected about the actual impacts of digital media on museums. © The Author 2015.

Citation segmentation from sparse & noisy data: A joint inference approach with Markov logic networks,1,10.1093/llc/fqu061,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84974674552&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqu061&partnerID=40&md5=c868ff8104f6649b3845d8b7c3985226,"This article presents an approach to citation segmentation that addresses special challenges as typically found in Digital Humanities applications. We perform citation segmentation from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) input obtained from volumes of a printed bibliography, the Turkology Annual. This showcase application features serious difficulties for state-of-the-art techniques in citation segmentation: multilingual citation entries, lack of data redundancy, inconsistencies, and noise from OCR input. Our approach is based on Markov logic networks (MLN) (Richardson and Domingos, Markov logic networks. Machine Learning, 62(1): 107-36, 2006), a framework of statistical relational learning that combines first-order logic with probabilistic modeling. Formalization in first-order logic offers high expressivity and flexibility, and makes it possible to tailor segmentation to specific conventions of a given bibliography. We show that in face of the specific difficulties found with segmenting references from a digitized bibliography, our MLN formalizations outperform state-of-the-art statistical methods. We obtain 88% F1-score for exact field match, a 24.8% increase over a conditional random fields-based system baseline. In contrast to prior work, we address a data set featuring sparse and noisy data. Our method extends Poon and Domingos (Joint Inference in information extraction. In Proceedings of the Twenty-Second National Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vancouver, Canada: AAAI Press, 2007)'s approach by applying joint inference at the field level. By this move, we are able to cope with the lack of citation redundancy and noise in the data. Our approach can be characterized as knowledge-based and hence does not rely on annotated training data. The rule sets we designed can be adapted to other bibliographies, or further types of digitized sources, such as historical dictionaries or encyclopedias. © The Author 2015.

It will trace the development of our SSHRC-funded SAGITTARIUS Literature Digitizing Project in the past seven years, especially the section on digitizing the works of George Bernard Shaw for schools in Canada. The project evolved through the digital humanities stage. Developed in collaboration with our industrial partner, the Ontario Research and Innovation Optical Network (ORION), our scholarly partner the International Shaw Society and the Shaw Festival, and other strategic partners in teaching and learning, first, it went through the theoretical framework of big data as we digitized and amassed a huge amount of data. Next, making use of the strategies of e-publishing and e-learning, we prepared the data for schools in Canada in packages according to the play texts complete with textual and contextual materials. We discovered that an ""inclusive humanities of the digital"" is needed. Our pilot studies in school classrooms with tablet computers proved that we have to design curricular materials with the students and teachers in mind. Instead of focusing on texts, digitized curricular materials have to address the cultural contexts of the diverse students in the classrooms. © Common Ground, Kay Li, All Rights Reserved.",Digital humanities,Inclusive classrooms,,,,,,,Li K.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the methods of G. K. Zipf are used to explore the digital history of the vocabulary of psychology. Zipf studied a great many phenomena, from word frequencies to city sizes, showing that they tend to have a characteristic distribution in which there are a few cases that occur very frequently and many more cases that occur very infrequently. We find that the number of new words and word senses that writers contribute to the vocabulary of psychology have such a Zipfian distribution. Moreover, those who make the most contributions, such as William James, tend also to invent new metaphorical senses of words rather than new words. By contrast, those who make the fewest contributions tend to invent entirely new words. The use of metaphor makes a text easier for a reader to understand. While the use of new words requires more effort on the part of the reader, it may lead to more precise understanding than does metaphor. On average, new words and word senses become a part of psychology's vocabulary in the time leading up to World War I, suggesting that psychology was ""finding its language"" (Danziger, 1997) during this period. © 2016 American Psychological Association.",Digital humanities,Metaphor,Polysemy,Vocabulary,Zipf,,,,Benjafield J.G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Situated in relation to a broader context of nineteenth-century manuscript digitization, it reflects both on the possibilities the digital environment offers for the study of manuscript life-writing, and on the timely and significant questions Bradley and Cooper’s diary raises for the field of manuscript digitization. By revisiting my earlier analysis of Bradley and Cooper’s collaborative life-writing, I probe the nature of their joint diary, asking what type of document it is and how it sits in relation to both nineteenth-century and contemporary understandings of life-writing. I then consider the new kinds of analysis and investigation the digitized diary will make possible, and the kind of new knowledge (historical and otherwise) we might seek from it. The journals of Michael Field are unusually materially complex objects, as well as being unusually rich in their narrative of identity formation. As such, I suggest, they provide a fascinating experimental field for digitization. Inspired by the ‘queer’ identity-construction of this dual-authored diary, the essay explores the possibilities for XML tagging as a tool for interpretation and analysis across large manuscript archives. © 2016 Leeds Trinity University.",diary,digital humanities,digitization,encoding,life-writing,Michael Field,queer,TEI,Thain M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some focus on service, while others conduct research and analysis or are more experimental with research and development applications. All of these usually claim an important component of collaboration, whether that is the sharing of ideas, resources, tools, or staff expertise. However, collaboration is often talked about but not practiced, whether in the library or across campus.

Open-access and digital environments encourage collaborative knowledge construction across time and space; thus the digital humanities provide a democratic platform that supports oral history's antihierarchical and anti-elitist imperatives. One of the major concerns expressed about the current shift of LGBTQ materials from community-based archives to institutional libraries, archives, and special collections is that collections will no longer be shaped by LGBTQ praxis.

The sense of a connection: Automatic tracing of intertextuality by meaning,9,10.1093/llc/fqu058,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84974717491&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqu058&partnerID=40&md5=fad73db0ffd85fe38a7e55d3f6ee7e22,"In literary study, intertextuality refers to the reuse of text, where new meaning or novel stylistic effects have been generated. Most typically in the digital humanities, algorithms for intertextual analysis search for approximate lexical correspondence that can be described as paraphrase. In this article, we look at a complimentary approach that more closely captures the behavior of the reader when faced with meaningful connections between texts in the absence of words that have the same form or stem, which constrains the match to semantics. The technique we employ for identifying such semantic intertextuality is the popular natural language processing strategy of semantic analysis. Unlike the typical scenario for semantic analysis, where a corpus of long form documents is available, we examine the far more limited textual fragments that embody intertextuality. We are primarily concerned with texts from antiquity, where small phrases or passages often form the locus of comparison. In this vein, we look at a specific case study of established parallels between book 1 of Lucan's Civil War and all of Vergil's Aeneid. Applying semantic analysis over these texts, we are able to recover parallels that lexical matching cannot, as well as discover new and interesting thematic matches between the two works. © The Author 2014.

We propose that above and beyond a general graph-based data model, which is becoming increasingly popular in many complex annotation formats, a well-defined concept of multiple, potentially conflicting segmentation layers must be introduced to deal with different sources and applications of corpus data flexibly. We also propose a generic solution for specialized corpus visualizations in a Web interface using annotation-triggered style sheets, which leverage the power of modern browsers and CSS for multiple and highly customizable views of primary data. We offer an implementation and evaluation of our architecture in ANNIS3, an open-source browser-based architecture for corpus search and visualization.

Examining a painting, an expert can determine its style, genre, and the time period that the painting belongs. One important task for art historians is to find influences and connections between artists. Is influence a task that a computer can measure? The contribution of this paper is in exploring the problem of computer-automated suggestion of influences between artists, a problem that was not addressed before in a general setting. We first present a comparative study of different classification methodologies for the task of fine-art style classification. A two-level comparative study is performed for this classification problem. The first level reviews the performance of discriminative vs. generative models, while the second level touches the features aspect of the paintings and compares semantic-level features vs. low-level and intermediate-level features present in the painting. Then, we investigate the question “Who influenced this artist?” by looking at his masterpieces and comparing them to others. We pose this interesting question as a knowledge discovery problem. For this purpose, we investigated several painting-similarity and artist-similarity measures. As a result, we provide a visualization of artists (Map of Artists) based on the similarity between their works © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",Automated artistic-influence discovery,Content-based image retrieval,Digital humanity,Image similarity,Knowledge discovery,Painting style classification,Unsupervised learning,,Saleh B.,Abe K.,Arora R.S.,Elgammal A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mellon Foundation, engaged five postdoctoral fellows placed in five different institutions to explore issues related to data curation for medieval studies. In May 2015, these fellows convened a two-day workshop on the sharing and publishing of Linked Open Data (LOD). Funded by a CLIR/Mellon microgrant, the workshop brought together librarians, technologists, and scholars to brainstorm on the challenges posed to medievalists in sharing data on digital platforms.2 The workshop offered a forum in which to discuss the complexity of medieval data and the challenges of sharing and publishing it. It enabled participants to appreciate LOD’s potential to express complicated data sets in our area of study and aid the navigation of those data sets, as well as understand how LOD can facilitate scholars to share and publish research outcomes more effectively. In this article, we take the lessons learned from the workshop and apply them to a set of complex data: 13th-century French motets, short pieces of music usually consisting of three lines and incorporating manifold connections and references. Following an outline of LOD, a detailed explanation of the motet and the manner of its composition will set the scene for elucidating the levels of complexity to be found in motet metadata, and hence why the LOD model can aid us in negotiating the data. We will then demonstrate an effective application of LOD by proposing a proof-of-concept system for organizing a select set of motets. © Edinburgh University Press 2016",Digital humanities,French,Linked Open Data,Medieval,Montpellier Codex,Motet,Music,Thirteenth century,Rose-Steel T.,Turnator E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we study how novel computational intelligence techniques can help to develop such facilities. More specifically, we describe how possibility theory can be used to model and handle the uncertainty that is inherent to vague, linguistic time specifications in a mathematically sound way. These mathematical time representations can then be stored in a database and advanced query evaluation techniques, for adequately coping with the represented uncertainty, can be used. Medieval charters are a typical example of documents on which related temporal information is often imperfect. To show the applicability of our technology, we illustrate how the development of the Diplomata Belgica database, a database describing medieval charters, can benefit from this novel technology. The added-value of the technology for future research in the humanities, in our case medieval history, is demonstrated by means of several illustrative query examples. © 2016 De Gruyter Oldenbourg.

While distance-based similarity models such as the Gesture Matching Distance on gesture signatures are able to leverage the spatial and temporal characteristics of gestural patterns, their applicability to large 3D motion capture databases is limited due to their high computational complexity. To this end, we present a lower bound approximation of the Gesture Matching Distance that can be utilized in an optimal multi-step query processing architecture in order to support efficient query processing. We investigate the performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency based on 3D motion capture databases and show that our approach is able to achieve an increase in efficiency of more than one order of magnitude with a negligible loss in accuracy. In addition, we discuss different applications in the digital humanities in order to highlight the significance of similarity search approaches in the research field of gestural pattern analysis. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.",3D motion capture data,dynamic time warping,Efficient query processing,gestural patterns,gesture matching distance,gesture signature,spatiotemporal data,,Beecks C.,Hassani M.,Brenger B.,Hinnell J.,Schüller D.,Mittelberg I.,Seidl T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ayers’ recent question, ‘Does Digital Scholarship have a future?’ As a way to think through current challenges and opportunities, this paper reflects on the building and initial use of the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI). As one of the largest projects in the history of the social sciences and humanities, CCRI enables research on the making of modern Canada by offering complex databases that cover the first half of the twentieth century. Built by scholars from multiple disciplines from coast-to-coast and in collaboration with government agencies and the private sector, CCRI team members came to grips with key DH questions especially those faced by interdisciplinary, multi-institutional, cross-sectoral and internationally-connected initiatives.

Networks of scholarly exchange, trade, kinship, and patronage are some of the many such longstanding subjects of study. Recent and ongoing digital humanities projects are now considering networks with fresh approaches and increasingly complex datasets. At the heart of these digital projects are ‘network ontologies’ — functional data models for distilling the complicated, messy connections between historical people, objects, and places. Although scholars creating network ontologies necessarily focus on different types of content, if these networks are to form a coherent body of scholarship in the future, we must work towards the creation interoperable ontological structures, rather than yet another set of competing standards. Here we examine the methodological considerations behind designing such interoperable ontologies, focusing primarily on the example of Early Modern historical networks. We argue that it would be infeasible to adopt a single ontological standard for all possible digital humanities projects; flexibility is essential to accommodate all subjects and objects of humanistic enquiry, from the micro-level to the longue-durée. However, we believe it possible to establish shared practices to structure these network ontologies on an ongoing basis in order to ensure their long-term interoperability. © Edinburgh University Press 2016",data modeling,early modern studies,historical studies,networks,ontologies,,,,Langmead A.,Otis J.M.,Warren C.N.,Weingart S.B.,Zilinksi L.D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It connects his early development of archaeological descriptive and typological metalanguages with his later elaboration of a theoretically informed approach to archaeological argumentation, analysis and publication, situates his logicist programme as a relevant contribution to the development of an archaeological “theory of practice”, grounded on reflexivity and modesty vis-à-vis the possibility of knowledge and the limits of scientism, and highlights aspects of Gardin’s work that point to potentially fruitful directions for contemporary research and practice in the field of archaeological informatics and digital humanities communication. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Archaeological reasoning,Data constitution,Digital publication,History of archaeological thought,Jean-Claude Gardin,Knowledge representation,Logicism,,Dallas C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our first hypothesis is that foresters at the beginning of the twentieth century were more concerned with production and less concerned with ecology than foresters at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Our second hypothesis is that US foresters in the early twentieth century were less concerned with local site conditions than Swedish foresters. We find that early foresters in both countries had broader—and often ecologically focused—concerns than hypothesized. Ecological concerns in the forestry literature have increased, but in the Nordic countries, production concerns have increased as well. In both regions and both time periods, timber management is closely connected to concerns about governance and state power, but the forms that governance takes have changed. © 2016, The Author(s).",Ecology,Forestry concepts,Governance,History,Sweden,The United States,,,Mårald E.,Langston N.,Sténs A.,Moen J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process is called profiling, if the object of interest is a person with individual attributes. The profiling of musicians similar to a musician of interest with the aid of visual means became an interesting research question for musicologists working with the Bavarian Musicians Encyclopedia Online. This paper illustrates the development of a visual analytics profiling system that is used to address such research questions. Taking musicological knowledge into account, we outline various steps of our collaborative digital humanities project, priority (1) the definition of various measures to determine the similarity of musicians' attributes, and (2) the design of an interactive profiling system that supports musicologists in iteratively determining similar musicians. The utility of the profiling system is emphasized by various usage scenarios illustrating current research questions in musicology. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",Data visualization,Databases,Music,Social network services,Uncertainty,Visual analytics,,,Jänicke S.,Focht J.,Scheuermann G.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, skepticism remains about how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result- vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",Context,Cultural differences,Data visualization,Fans,Metadata,Statistical analysis,Visualization,,Hinrichs U.,Forlini S.,Moynihan B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the other end of the spectrum is a practice at the heart of the traditional humanities, close reading - the careful, in-depth analysis of a single text in order to extract, engage, and even generate as much productive meaning as possible. The true value of computation to close reading is still very much an open question. During a two-year design study, we explored this question with several poetry scholars, focusing on an investigation of sound and linguistic devices in poetry. The contributions of our design study include a problem characterization and data abstraction of the use of sound in poetry as well as Poemage, a visualization tool for interactively exploring the sonic topology of a poem. The design of Poemage is grounded in the evaluation of a series of technology probes we deployed to our poetry collaborators, and we validate the final design with several case studies that illustrate the disruptive impact technology can have on poetry scholarship.

Such is the claim made by Miguel Escobar Varela in this article, which he furthers by exploring the similarities between the ways theatre makers and software programmers speak about their crafts. Understanding software programming as an essentially creative process should be of interest for theatre scholars, who are constantly searching for modes of academic discourse that are sensitive to the specificity of theatre. By offering examples from interface design for the study of Javanese theatre, Escobar argues that creating software, through an iterative process of trial and error, can become part of the methodological palette of theatre scholars.

Who holds the key to Holocaust-related sources? Authorship as subjectivity in finding aids,2,10.1080/17504902.2015.1118193,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85066865942&doi=10.1080%2f17504902.2015.1118193&partnerID=40&md5=e00327ad80b1b218861ba409dc2a54c8,"The field of Holocaust studies relies on a wide variety of archives, dispersed all over the world. Identifying the right sources for a specific research question within this field is not easy or straightforward. Yet Holocaust scholars predominately focus on methodologies for source analysis rather than discovery. Archival finding aids are among the most important tools to aid primary source discovery, but have hitherto not been considered in methodological discussions on Holocaust research. In this article we will reflect on the composition of finding aids based on our work for the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI). Our premise is that the content of finding aids is determined by their authors and the context in which they are creating them. The strongest argument for this subjectivity is that our work–outlined in this article–not only indicates that descriptions of one and the same source differ, but that they can do so quite considerably, and hence can influence research. Our stance is that historians optimize their profit from finding aids by becoming more sensitive to the subjectivity and authorship of descriptions. We conclude by showing how an online environment such as the one developed by EHRI can sensitize historians and archivists to the situated and subjective nature of finding aids by accommodating a plurality of descriptive voices, and encourage them to share their knowledge and become co-authors of finding aids. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

Gateway to the Syriac saints: A database project,2,10.1163/21659214-90000074,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107148715&doi=10.1163%2f21659214-90000074&partnerID=40&md5=c827103b6ae8d7fbed82824d35ec9c06,"This article describes The Gateway to the Syriac Saints, a database project developed by the Syriac Reference Portal (www.syriaca.org). It is a research tool for the study of Syriac saints and hagiographic texts. The Gateway to the Syriac Saints is a two-volume database: 1) Qadishe and 2) Bibliotheca Hagiographica Syriaca Electronica (BHSE). Hagiography, the lives of the saints, is a multiform genre. It contains elements of myth, history, biblical exegesis, romance, and theology. The production of saints' lives blossomed in late antiquity alongside the growth of the cult of the saints. Scholars have attended to hagiographic traditions in Greek and Latin, but many scholars have yet to discover the richness of Syriac hagiographic literature: the stories, homilies, and hymns on the saints that Christians of the Middle East told and preserved. It is our hope that our database will give scholars and students increased access to these traditions to generate new scholarship. The first volume, Qadishe or “saints” in Syriac, is a digital catalogue of saints or holy persons venerated in the Syriac tradition. Some saints are native to the Syriac-speaking milieu, whereas others come from other linguistic or cultural traditions. Through the translation of their hagiographies and the diffusion of saints' cults in the late antique world, saints were adopted, “imported,” and appropriated into Syriac religious memory. The second volume, the BHSE, focuses on Syriac hagiographic texts. The BHSE contains the titles of over 1000 Syriac stories, hymns, and homilies on saints. It also includes authors' or hagiographers' names, the first and last lines of the texts (in Syriac, English, and French), bibliographic information, and the names of the manuscripts containing these hagiographic works. We have also listed modern and ancient translations of these works. All of the data in the Gateway to the Syriac Saints has been encoded in TEI, and it is fully searchable, linkable, and open. © 2016 Brill.

In a time when churches on a large scale are concerned with how to communicate with people through digital media, the Laestadian movement choses another path, based upon other assumptions and choices. The focus here is on how congregations and representatives use digital media, and not on individual and private use, and this article will focus primarily on Sweden and Finland. Based on interviews with representatives and by mapping the congregations' online presence, this article provides an interpretation of the use of the internet within Laestadianism. Through this group, we see how ideology, faith, and practices regulate a restricted, negotiated, and conscious use of the internet, which challenges any preconceptions regarding use and effect of the internet on religion. This case study therefore gives additional perspective for understanding the role of digital media within and in relation to institutionalized Christianity. © 2016 Brill.

Proposing some new ecliptics in new testament studies enabled by digital humanities-based methods,0,10.1163/21659214-90000072,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85107122387&doi=10.1163%2f21659214-90000072&partnerID=40&md5=452df33d6a8d032347f535e21051fc04,"“Fragmentation” is a well-worn watchword in contemporary biblical studies. But is endless fragmentation across the traditional domains of epistemology, methodology and hermeneutics the inevitable future for the postmodern exercise of biblical scholarship? In our view, multiple factors mitigate against such a future, but two command our attention here. First, digital humanities itself, through its principled use of corpora, databases and computer-based methods, seems to be remarkably capable of producing findings with high levels of face validity (interpretive agreement) across multiple hermeneutical perspectives and communities. Second, and perhaps more subversively, there is a substantial body of practitioners that, per Kearney, actively question postmodernity's impress as the final port of call for philosophy. For these practitioners deconstruction has become both indispensable - by delegitimizing hegemonies - but, in its own way, metanarratival by stultifying all other iterative, dialectical and critical processes that have historically motivated scholarship. Sensing this impasse, Kearney (1987, pp. 43-45) proposes a reimagining that is not only critical but that also embraces ποίησις, the possibility of optimistic, creative work. Such a stance within digital humanities would affirm that poietic events emerge not only through frictions and fragmentation (e.g. Kinder and McPherson 2014, pp. xiii-xviii) but also through commonalties and convergence. Our approach here will be to demonstrate such a reimagining, rather than to argue for it, using two worked examples in the Greek New Testament (GNT). Those examples - digital humanities-enabled papyrology and digital humanities-enabled statistical linguistics - demonstrate ways in which the data of the text itself can be used to interrogate our perspectives and suggest that our perspectives must remain ever open to such inquiries. We conclude with a call for digital humanities to further leverage its notable strengths to cast new light on old problems not only in biblical studies, but across the spectrum of the humanities. © 2016 Brill.

It documents new archival evidence for the scope of this textual tradition. The combination of digital textual and archival evidence provides important clues for building hypotheses for an expanded reception history of the Arabic text in Europe. Using corpora built in three languages-Castilian, Latin and French-it leverages stylometric analysis to explore the discursive communities in which the translations may have emerged and where they took on new meanings. The article puts medium-scale stylometry into practice in the field of comparative literature and translation studies for the exploration of large text collections, and suggests how quantitative methods could be deployed in translingual corpus-level literary research. It also argues for the use of stylometry at early stages of literary historical research to discover new paths of inquiry. © 2016 Brill.

The goal of the project is to create methods for computer-supported, interactive analysis that can be applied to a large corpus of historical textbooks on history and geography (∼5000 volumes). A first version of a tool for text analysis has been created based on a user centered design process, including a contextual study on current work practices of historians, participative design workshops, and the prioritization of requirements with the project stakeholders. In addition, several generations of text models used in these tools have been iteratively evaluated by the historians in the project. In the context of a cooperative validation study, researchers have used these tools to examine existing hypotheses from the field. The method enables the validation of text models regarding established knowledge, provides additional insights into the requirements for tools and visualizations, and helps to strengthen the expert users' trust in the tools. Based on the findings, this paper proposes four principles for the analysis of a corpus of historical texts. Moreover, the methods presented are discussed regarding the application of user centered design in the context of digital humanities projects.

Writers like Goethe, Austen and Scott developed a new genre, the Bildungsroman, in which young, enthusiastic protagonists explore the world, develop themselves and find a place to remain. This, at least, has been a popular argument in modern criticism. Recently, however, Nancy Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse have brought it into question. Studying a number of British and American novels, they show that an alternative genre, the ‘network novel’, arose in the period, which ‘disrupted’ the image of an organic, domestic world that lay at the heart of the ‘domestic novel’ (their term for the classical Bildungsroman). Here, I propose that the ‘network novel’ and the ‘domestic novel’ can actually be seen as two distinct but interrelated aspects of the Bildungsroman. To demonstrate this, I use Maria Edgeworth’s The Absentee (1812) as a case study, utilising Franco Moretti’s innovative digital technique, ‘character network analysis’, to analyse its structure. © Australasian Universities Language and Literature Association 2016.",Bildungsroman,Character network analysis,Digital humanities,Long eighteenth century,Maria Edgeworth,The Absentee (1812),,,Falk M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities).

The authors analysed 45 articles in order to draw a picture of research in this area. In the first phase, the articles were classified, and relevant quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Results showed that three clear strands of research do exist: Digital Libraries, Networked Scholarship and Digital Humanities. Moreover, researchers involved in this research area tackle the problems related to technological uptake in the scholar's profession from different points of view, and define the field in different-often complementary-ways, thus generating the perception of a research area still in need of a unifying vision. In the second phase, authors searched for evidence of the disciplinary contributions and interdisciplinary cohesion of research carried out in this area through the use of bibliometric maps. Results suggest that the area of Digital Scholarship, still in its infancy, is advancing in a rather fragmentedway, shaping itself around the above-mentioned strands, each with its own research agenda. However, results from the cross-citation analysis suggest that the Networked Scholarship strand is more cohesive than the others in terms of cross-citations. © 2016 J.E.

The study, however, finds that there is no semantic or pragmatic contrast in the usage of the two phrases, though changes in the relative frequency of use reflect larger changes in the centers of literary production and political power and the dialects of those centers. The study concludes that formal written Arabic must be treated as an autonomous register which has developed according to the needs of that register and therefore written Arabic reflects the spoken language only to a small degree. © Center for Arab Studies.",Corpus linguistics,Demonstratives,Digital humanities,Diglossia,Philology,,,,Magidow A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has led to a framework of study known as digital humanities that is characterised by, among other things, the parameters of a ‘cultural convergence’ and that offers new possibilities and challenges for the more classical understanding of culture, as the latter shifts towards a digital culture and global connectivity. This article analyses different concepts such as intermedia and transmedia, among others, as models that are bringing practices and opportunities to the study of Literature and Culture. Along with these two concepts, we also take up the notions of hybridisation, performativity, dissolution and the opening of storytelling, illustrating them with examples by various authors, such as Celia Parra, Mónica Ezquerra and Aram Bartholl. The act of defining to what extent literature and the humanities or arts have become an expanded field, serving as a semiotic model of discourse for other emerging media, from an intermedia and transmedia perspective, with an agonistic push of energeia, of tension, forces us to change the ways we look at them and emphasises the importance of a collaborative effort, the main exponent of our collective intelligence. © 2016, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya.

For example, digital storytelling is characterized by interactivity, nonlinearity, flexible outcomes, user participation, even co-creation. Such affordances may be disruptive to traditional humanities scholars accustomed to working alone, with physical objects, and following established theoretical guidelines. However, they may be quite appealing to those seeking new opportunities for cross-disciplinary, iterative approaches to practice-based humanities scholarship and pedagogy. This essay defines digital storytelling as a combination of storytelling techniques, digital affordances, and humanities foci, describes several forms of digital storytelling, outlines frameworks and outcomes associated with their use, and promotes digital storytelling as providing new opportunities for humanities scholarship and teaching, especially with regard to critical thinking, communication, digital literacy, and civic engagement. © 2016 The Author(s).",Critical thinking,Digital humanities,Digital literacy,Digital storytelling,Digital tools,Multimedia,Narrative,Oral history,Barber J.F.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disappearance of the author and meaning making,8,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84996479874&partnerID=40&md5=56694dbe8768678e3ec4999460af1ab3,"The study is aimed at the analysis of the consequences of the disappearance of the author as a unifying principle organizing meaning and determining the interpretation of the text in the era of digital media and hypertext. It is based on the movement aimed at the displacement of the concept of the author from this dominant position, reflecting the approaches of thinkers such as U. Eco, R. Barthes and M. Foucault. These authors particularly understand the text as a space in which intertextual relations dominate and readership perception replaces the principle of the author. More than a natural extension of these considerations is the area of texts published in electronic version, which, according to J. D. Bolter, allow significantly greater fragmentation and differentiation than printed texts, which even more reinforces their perceptual aspects. Reconstruction or rather making of meaning in the process of reading is subject to certain specifics that are at the centre of our consideration because there also appears the spectre of what remained of the author, as some of his features are still present in the text. Consequently, we move to the description of double writing: Writing the self and writing culture. Relying on Bolter's as well as Foucault's analysis, we can say that hypertext writing is an ongoing process of eclectic writing and self-publishing. It is exactly the way we acquire a new virtual identity that enables and stands in the basics of digital communities. If hypertext is a place of this constitutive practice of subjectification, this means not only a return to the origins of philosophy, that is to the practice of the care for the self, which it always has been, but also the beginning of a new era of reading, writing and thinking.",Author,Digital humanities,Hypertext,Jay david bolter,The internet,Writing,,,Debnár M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hmong, an indigenous group originally living in East Asia, created many of the story cloths exhibited on HmongEmbroidery.org in Thai refugee camps following the Vietnam War, during which they assisted the United States CIA against the Viet Cong and Pathet Lao. Displaced by enemy forces from their homes through violent means and surviving in precarious conditions, Hmong women embroidered their stories onto cloth. Because Hmong language did not become an alphabet until the 1950s, and because traumatic accounts often exist outside of language, the story cloths largely remain uninterpretable, even as they account for Hmong experience. Interpreting the story cloths, in most cases, would only project exterior frames of reference onto their meanings. In this way, Hmong story cloths account for Hmong experience, history, and displacement while revealing the poverty of interpretation when taken up as a critical reading strategy assuming mastery. This essay reads closely in a descriptive mode, showing how HmongEmbroidery.org's story cloth exhibits demonstrate the importance and urgency of digital humanities projects that archive experiences of displacement and make them accessible to transnational audiences vis-à-vis the internet. © 2016 Journal of International Women's Studies.",Digital humanities,Displacement,Embroidery,Hmong,Interpretation,,,,Hickner-Johnson C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From those, services display the highest churn rate. The reasons are twofold. First, new versions or new services emerge, gain popularity, and have to be provisioned by infrastructure operators. Secondly, the demand to make research reproducible inclines the users to share the software they used to obtain their results. Coming to grips with these high churn rates is not easy, but has the potential to speed-up scientific discovery. In this paper we will describe an extensible Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution conceived to facilitate seamless exchange, evolution, and deployment of software services in distributed environments. In opposite to ordinary SaaS solutions, the portfolio of the software services in our approach is extensible. We implemented means for users and developers to make their services readily available in the distributed infrastructure with minimal overhead. In this process, not only the actual software is made available but also the knowledge of how to install and configure it is conveyed, thus running instances of the new service can be provided right away. We will share the experience gained during the implementation of the extensible SaaS solution for DARIAH-DE research infrastructure. It was used to provision on-demand instances of software used in digital humanities. Subsequently, the same solution was reused in a completely different context to provide on-demand instances of UNICORE Grid middleware for training and testing purposes. The operation of our extensible SaaS, yielded additional requirements and extensions. In particular, the need for monitoring and measuring the resource usage were identified and addressed. The presented insights can help to address the problem of exchange and provision of scientific software. Other distributed infrastructures can incorporate them to improve the scalability, maintainability, user-friendliness, and sustainability of their platforms. © 2016 SCPE.",Cloud computing,Distributed systems,Service sharing,,,,,,Rybicki J.,Von St Vieth B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article addresses the question of how current computational text-mining approaches can be used as tools for clarifying what aesthetics is when such approaches are combined with philosophical analyses of the field. We suggest that conjoining the two points of view leads to a fuller picture than excluding one or the other, and that such a picture is useful for the self-understanding of the discipline. Our analysis suggests that text-mining tools can find sources, relations, and trends in a new way, but it also reveals that the databases that such tools use are presently seriously limited. However, computational approaches that are still in their infancy in aesthetics will most likely gradually affect our understanding about the ontological status of the discipline and its instantiations. © 2016 O.

Is there a role for computational text analysis in the process of sensemaking? We propose that topic modeling, when conceived as a process of thematic exploration, can provide a new entry point into this process. To this end, we present research on a new software tool called TOME: Interactive TOpic Model and MEtadata Visualization, designed to support the exploratory thematic analysis of digitized archival collections. TOME is centered around a set of visualizations intended to facilitate the interpretation of the topic model and its incorporation into extant humanities research practices. In contrast to other topic model browsers, which present the model on its own terms, ours is informed by the process of conducting early-stage humanities research. Our article thus also demonstrates the conceptual conversions-in terms of both design and process-that interdisciplinary collaboration necessarily entails. In making these conversions explicit, and exploring the implications of their successes and failures, we take up the call, as voiced by Johanna Drucker (Humanities approaches to graphical display. Digital Humanities Quarterly, 5(1), 2011), to resist the 'intellectual Trojan horse' of visualization. We seek to model a new mode of interdisciplinary inquiry, one that brings the methodological emphasis of the digital humanities to bear on the practices of humanities research and computer science alike. © The Author 2015.

Half the students had a pinned edition and half a more traditional one, while they all had several hours to explore the same eight-page crew agreement from the late 19th century. They then filled out quizzes, short answer tests, and went through an extensive debriefing. The results surprised us. Form made no difference whatsoever, none of the students understood the document's content. We concluded their difficulty stemmed from living in the immediate, rather than in a temporally informed present, and so they could not fathom the profundity of the past. Seeking to understand this dramatic foreshortening of the analytics of existence, an issue of general interest to humanists, we searched for guidance in the digital humanities and educational literatures with little success. Borrowing from more progressive writings on academic literacy, our solution is a Friere-inspired approach that privileges points of entry for our undergraduates that build on their alreadyexisting knowledge, rather than requiring them to acquire a canonical and frankly out-dated learned past. We argue this critical approach allows our students a democratizing experience that permits them to more fully engage the world as informed citizens. © The Author 2015.

However, we lack case studies of how these methods can be applied in practice and what their potential impact may be. Trading Consequences is an interdisciplinary research project between environmental historians, computational linguists, and visualization specialists. It combines text mining and information visualization alongside traditional research methods in environmental history to explore commodity trade in the 19th century from a global perspective. Along with a unique data corpus, this project developed three visual interfaces to enable the exploration and analysis of four historical document collections, consisting of approximately 200,000 documents and 11 million pages related to commodity trading. In this article, we discuss the potential and limitations of our approach based on feedback from historians we elicited over the course of this project. Informing the design of such tools in the larger context of digital humanities projects, our findings show that visualizationbased interfaces are a valuable starting point to large-scale explorations in historical research. Besides providing multiple visual perspectives on the document collection to highlight general patterns, it is important to provide a context in which these patterns occur and offer analytical tools for more in-depth investigations. © The Author 2015.

To answer this question, the article attempts to address the topic of the text and its possible practical and theoretical variations from digitization. The text plays a major role within the humanities because it is at the same time, the primary object of study, knowledge production and dissemination. The article argues that although digitalization requires us to redefine our notion of 'text' because it has changed its nature and has opened an intense discussion about what this is, is not broken either theoretically or practically with the paradigm of what is printed.

In what way can the methodologies linked to the development of digital technology help us to update or deepen our knowledge of this artistic field? Digital technology enables a range of different methods of analysis for the performing arts. We can identify three distinct approaches: notation, annotation and denotation. The notation of a piece makes it possible to provide a score that can, if required, be interpreted using other technologies without affecting the initial artistic intentions; annotation makes it possible to comment on and refine the information gathered from different documents; and denotation allows us to identify crucial information in a sea of documents and to move away from close reading. Finding ways to combine notation, annotation and denotation could help one to get as close as possible to the complex nature of these works and the creative process behind them. Rekall, described in this paper, is an environment that makes it possible to combine these different modes within a single interface. It allows us to combine close reading with distant reading, manual annotation with data visualization and the notation of artistic scores with automatic metadata extraction techniques. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,Bardiot C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The theoretical impetus for the analysis is provided by N. [Catherine Hayles's investigation of ""the contemporary pressure toward dematerialization"" caused by the growing popularity of digital machines and the science of cybernetics, which, apart from influencing our understanding of the idea of the human, affects also our perception of textual embodiment. As a result, the materiality of books starts to be regarded as something expendable, an old-fashioned kind of interface with no meaning whatsoever. Disgreeing with this view of books, Hayles argues that textual materiality is one of their essential characteristics, as the physical form plays an important role in the cultural chain of these texts' production, assimilation, and influence. Taking into account works by Hayles and other writers dealing with book history, editing, archival science, and the digital revolution in general, the article proceeds to analyze, first, the conflict over digitization of an academic library as depicted in Vinge's novel, and second, me creative crisis that the main character-a poet-experiences as a result. Ultimately, it is argued, the relationship among author, text, and reader, as presented in the novel, illuminates debates about textual materiality taking place in contemporary digital-humanities scholarship.",,,,,,,,,Kozioł S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With regard to Avestan, they may allow for the identification of ceremonial frames or opening and closing sections revealing the compositional structure of a ceremony. In case of manuscript comparison, the question arises whether a variant appears only once or in all of its repetitive passages. Furthermore, by analysing the compositional structure we may be able to detect ceremonial structures different to the practice of today. A secondary aspect relates to the interpretation of the grammaticality of Young Avestan passages. The repetition analysis provides evidence that passages which are hitherto considered ill-formed actually follow the rules of Avestan grammar. The scope of this study is to investigate computational means for detecting repetitive sequences.

The ethnically Slovenian territory was multilingual and multicultural; it belonged to different state entities with distant capitals, which was reflected in the spatial dynamic of literary culture. The research results have confirmed the hypotheses of the research project ‘The Space of Slovenian Literary Culture,’ which were based on postulates of the spatial turn: the sociogeographical space influenced the development of literature and its media, whereas literature itself, through its discourse, practices and institutions, had a reciprocal influence on the apprehension and structuring of that space, as well as on its connection with the broader region. Slovenian literary discourse was able to manifest itself in public predominantly through the history of spatial factors: (a) the formation, territorial expansion and concentration of the social network of literary actors and media; (b) the persistent references of literary texts to places that were recognized by addressees as Slovenian, thereby grounding a national ideology. Taking all of this into account, and based on meta-theoretical reflection, the project aims to contribute to the development of digital humanities and spatial literary studies. © Edinburgh University Press 2015",literary atlas,literary geography,literary history,mapping,Slovenian literary culture,spatial analysis,,,Juvan M.,Dokler J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His plays have been translated into every major living language. In some languages, his plays have been retranslated many times. These translations and retranslations have evolved for about 250 years. Studying variations in translations of world cultural heritage texts is of cross-cultural interest for arts and humanities researchers. The variations between retranslations are due to numerous factors, including the differing purposes of translations, genetic relations, cultural and intercultural influences, rivalry between translators and their varying competence. A team of Digital Humanities researchers has collected an experimental corpus of 55 different German retranslations of Shakespeare's play, Othello. The retranslations date between 1766 and 2010. A sub-corpus of 32 retranslations has been prepared as a digital parallel corpus. We would like to develop methods of exploring patterns in variation between different translations. In this article, we develop an interactive focus + context visualization system to present, analyse and explore variation at the level of user-defined segments. From our visualization, we are able to obtain an overview of the relationships of similarity between parallel segments in different versions. We can uncover clusters and outliers at various scales, and a linked focus view allows us to further explore the textual details behind these findings. The domain experts who are studying this topic evaluate our visualizations, and we report their feedback. Our system helps them better understand the relationships between different German retranslations of Othello and derive some insight. © The Author(s) 2014.",Othello,Segment variation,text visualization,,,,,,Geng Z.,Cheesman T.,Laramee R.S.,Flanagan K.,Thiel S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach – Using 1,756 records of product-related location names in Products in Local Chronicles of Guangdong of the Qing dynasty, which are recognized by a name recognition system, as attribute data; taking the spatial data of Chinese administrative geography of the Qing dynasty in 1820 and the Historical Atlas of China as spatial data; connect the attribute data with relevant spatial data based on the table connection function of Arcmap in Arcgis 8.3 to implement the data management, cartography and analysis. Findings – The application of GIS in the development and utilization of ancient local chronicles was quite successful. With some thematic maps, knowledge about products distribution and dispersal in ancient books was vividly displayed so as to facilitate relevant researches. Research limitations/implications – Only product-related location names inside China were analyzed, not other named entities in local chronicles; and only static visual display was achieved, not dynamic visual display. Historical maps of the world can be used to carry out the visualization of the products distribution and dispersal in the world, and even the visualization of other knowledge, such as poetries and songs scattered over many places in China. The process of products dispersal and the distribution of poetries and songs can be dynamically and visually displayed by pictures, audios, videos, multimedia, etc. Practical implications – By using GIS in the development and utilization of Chinese ancient local chronicles, this paper explores a new way for the collation of ancient books and open up a new area for the research of digital humanities.

It explores quantitative methods for analysing literary representations of the wolf in Portuguese literature on a temporal and spatial basis, from an enlarged literary corpus. A grid analysis covers the entire sample's content and encompasses the various forms that relationships between humans and nature can take. Quantitative analysis reveals that wolves have been common narrative elements since the late nineteenth century. However, the proportion of wolf literary representations was not independent of time period of publication: a strong decline occurred in the works published after 1980. We also found that most of the contemporary writers that mention wolves place the narrative in a previous time. Wolf literary representations maintained their basic pattern in structure across time. They combined a variety of topics, approaches and perspectives, although they tended to be less rich and less diverse in terms of their composition. Although the Portuguese literary wolf is a widespread creature, it is not homogeneously distributed in the territory and its geographic distribution throughout time shows a notorious reduction trend that matches the evolution of the species' natural range and demography. © The Author 2013.

But what the word means is unclear. To define it precisely, two studies examined the American Psychological Association's system of controlled vocabulary-specifically, the 447 associated terms it presents-and used techniques from the Digital Humanities to identify 88 closely related concepts and six broad conceptual clusters. The resulting analyses show how similar ideas are interrelated: self-control, self-management, self-observation, learning, social behavior, and the personality constructs related to self-monitoring. A full-color network map locates these concepts and clusters relative to each other. It also highlights some of the interests of different audiences, which can be described heuristically using two axes that have been labeled abstract versus practical and self-oriented versus other-oriented.

Can educational video games increase high school students' interest in theatre?,24,10.1016/j.compedu.2015.06.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84936879143&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2015.06.006&partnerID=40&md5=1226bb27828f07e6d131fb4b8e407048,"Abstract The value of educational video games in education is undeniable and the benefits of using video games in classroom instruction have been proved by many researchers. Nevertheless, these benefits have not been proved sufficiently for some domains, such as artistic disciplines. In this paper we explore the effects of an educational video game on high school students' interest towards classical theatre. The game covers the story of ""The Foolish Lady"" (La Dama Boba) based on the homonymous classic theatre play by Spanish playwright Lope de Vega. A mixed experimental design was followed, whereby researchers conducted pre-tests and post-tests to estimate the effect of playing the video game on student interest (within-subjects factor) towards theatre. We also measured changes in linguistic knowledge and knowledge about the play. The experiment was carried out with 754 students from 8 different schools in the Madrid region in Spain, divided into experimental group and two control groups. With the objective of improving the comparative power of the study, two control groups were used: (1) traditional teaching with the usual teacher and, (2) as the best educative case we could implement, teaching with a professional actor who had played the male protagonist of the theatre play. The experimental group played the video game. Results show that the video game was more effective in incrementing students' interest in theatre than the traditional class, but slightly less effective than the class with the actor. On the other hand, game and teacher approaches obtained similar results in the improvement of students' knowledge about the play's plot and some linguistic concepts. These results open up a new horizon in using video games as motivators in different artistic domains. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Digital humanities,Educational games,Media in education,Serious games,Theatre learning,,,,Manero B.,Torrente J.,Serrano Á.,Martínez-Ortiz I.,Fernández-Manjón B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Solving this task can have important applications in the digital humanities and computational social sciences, by supporting the geospatial analysis of large document collections. We combine multiple features that capture the similarity between candidate disambiguations, the place references, and the context where the place references occur, in order to rank and choose from a set of candidate disambiguations, obtained from a knowledge base containing geospatial coordinates and textual descriptions for different places from all around the world. The proposed method was evaluated through English corpora used in previous work in this area, and also with a subset of the English Wikipedia. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is indeed effective, showing that out-of-the-box learning algorithms and relatively simple features can obtain a high accuracy in this task. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Entity linking in text,Geographic text mining and retrieval,Learning to rank,Place reference disambiguation,,,,,Santos J.,Anastácio I.,Martins B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Networks of digital humanities scholars: The informational and social uses and gratifications of Twitter,39,10.1177/2053951715589417,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84975789217&doi=10.1177%2f2053951715589417&partnerID=40&md5=58b7cf77d6fbde7a7bac0d035d04b43a,"Big Data research is currently split on whether and to what extent Twitter can be characterized as an informational or social network. We contribute to this line of inquiry through an investigation of digital humanities (DH) scholars’ uses and gratifications of Twitter. We conducted a thematic analysis of 25 semi-structured interview transcripts to learn about these scholars’ professional use of Twitter. Our findings show that Twitter is considered a critical tool for informal communication within DH invisible colleges, functioning at varying levels as both an information network (learning to ‘Twitter’ and maintaining awareness) and a social network (imagining audiences and engaging other digital humanists). We find that Twitter follow relationships reflect common academic interests and are closely tied to scholars’ pre-existing social ties and conference or event co-attendance. The concept of the invisible college continues to be relevant but requires revisiting. The invisible college formed on Twitter is messy, consisting of overlapping social contexts (professional, personal and public), scholars with different habits of engagement, and both formal and informal ties. Our research illustrates the value of using multiple methods to explore the complex questions arising from Big Data studies and points toward future research that could implement Big Data techniques on a small scale, focusing on sub-topics or emerging fields, to expose the nature of scholars’ invisible colleges made visible on Twitter. © The Author(s) 2015.",Big Data,digital humanities (DH),scholars,social media,social networks,Twitter,Uses and gratifications,,Quan-Haase A.,Martin K.,McCay-Peet L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Convergence of digital humanities and digital libraries,36,10.1108/LM-09-2014-0116,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84930431324&doi=10.1108%2fLM-09-2014-0116&partnerID=40&md5=5f2f3f364f00ecafea2acbb20cc597be,"Purpose – Digital humanities (DH) has become a much discussed topic among both humanities scholars and library professionals. The library and information science (LIS) community has taken efforts in providing new facilities and developing new services to meet humanities scholars’ changing research behaviors and needs employing digital tools and methods. How to effectively collaborate with the DH community has been a challenging task to LIS in their digital library (DL) development endeavors. The purpose of this paper is to discover productive ways for LIS to support DH scholarship, specifically, what DL components, including content, technology, and service, should and could be developed for digital humanists. Design/methodology/approach – As an initial effort of the Digital Humanities Interest Group at University of California, Irvine Libraries, the examination is primarily based on a cross-boundary environmental scan in both DH and DL fields. The environmental survey includes both a literature review and web and physical site visits. The survey results, especially a gap analysis between the behaviors and needs of humanities scholars and the digital content, technologies, and services currently offered by the DL community, are used to shape the proposed roles of DH librarianship. Findings – First, DH’s innovative approach to research and teaching practices brings opportunities and challenges. Second, DH research is collaborative work. Third, major channels are established for the DH community. Fourth, various tools and data sets are developed to support different types of projects. Fifth, DH community has unbalanced geographical and disciplinary distribution. Sixth, DH research output still lacks attention, integration, and sustainability. Finally, LIS professionals play unique roles in DH projects. Overall, the communities of DH and DL share common goals and tasks. Practical implications – This paper proposes these present and future roles of LIS professionals: creator and contributor; curator; messenger and liaison; educator; mediator and interpreter; host; partner; innovator; “hybrid scholar”; advocate; consultant. At the organizational level, libraries should demonstrate higher efficiency and effectiveness in the services by revamping organizational culture or structure to stimulate and realize more and deeper cross-boundary conversations and collaborations. On a larger scale, the DL community should strive to become more visible, valuable, and approachable to the DH community; and even better, become part of it. Originality/value – This paper examines both DH and DL fields critically and connects the two communities by discovering gaps and commonalities. Based on the findings, the authors recommend roles and actions to be taken by LIS professionals, libraries, and the DL community. This paper is valuable to both humanities scholars who are seeking support in their research using digital methods and LIS professionals who are interested in providing more effective and suitable services. The paper also helps library administrators and aspiring librarians better understand the concept of DH and grasp insight on the present and future of DH librarianship. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Digital curation,Digital humanities,Digital libraries,Faculty-librarian collaboration,Scholarly communication,,,,Zhang Y.,Liu S.,Mathews E.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploring entity recognition and disambiguation for cultural heritage collections,34,10.1093/llc/fqt067,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84974731274&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqt067&partnerID=40&md5=0a74adaa97dc2117b8459f5ae20eb57a,"Unstructured metadata fields such as 'description' offer tremendous value for users to understand cultural heritage objects. However, this type of narrative information is of little direct use within a machine-readable context due to its unstructured nature. This article explores the possibilities and limitations of named-entity recognition (NER) and term extraction (TE) to mine such unstructured metadata for meaningful concepts. These concepts can be used to leverage otherwise limited searching and browsing operations, but they can also play an important role to foster Digital Humanities research. To catalyze experimentation with NER and TE, the article proposes an evaluation of the performance of three third-party entity extraction services through a comprehensive case study, based on the descriptive fields of the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York. To cover both NER and TE, we first offer a quantitative analysis of named entities retrieved by the services in terms of precision and recall compared with a manually annotated gold-standard corpus, and then complement this approach with a more qualitative assessment of relevant terms extracted. Based on the outcomes of this double analysis, the conclusions present the added value of entity extraction services, but also indicate the dangers of uncritically using NER and/or TE, and by extension Linked Data principles, within the Digital Humanities. All metadata and tools used within the article are freely available, making it possible for researchers and practitioners to repeat the methodology. By doing so, the article offers a significant contribution towards understanding the value of entity recognition and disambiguation for the Digital Humanities. © The Author 2013.

Traditional methods of assessment of impact in the humanities, notably citation in scholarly publications, are not an effective way of assessing impact of digital content. These issues are problematic in the field of Digital Humanities where there is a need to effectively assess impact to justify its continued funding and existence. A number of qualitative and quantitative methods exist that can be used to monitor the use of digital resources in various contexts although they have yet to be applied widely. These have been made available to the creators, managers, and funders of digital content in an accessible form through the TIDSR (Toolkit for the Impact of Digital Scholarly Resources) developed by the Oxford Internet Institute. In 2011, the authors of this article developed the SPHERE project (Stormont Parliamentary Hansards: Embedded in Research and Education) specifically to use TIDSR to evaluate the use and impact of The Stormont Papers, a digital collection of the Hansards of the Stormont Northern Irish Parliament from 1921 to 1972.

The trail aims to reinforce collective memory about the major events that occurred in the early moments leading to the coup. The trail is made up by nine places of rememberance, for which literary excerpts are suggested and which are supported by a digital research procedure. A set of seven fixed and observer-independent categories are used to analyse the literary contents of 23 literary works published up to 2013. These literary works refer to events that happened between the eve of April 25 and May 1, 1974. At the same time, literary descriptions are explored using a spatial approach in order to define the literary geography of the most iconic military actions and popular demonstrations that occurred in Lisbon and the surroundings. The literary geography and the cartography of the historical events are then compared.

The present study examines the connections of a 7-year interdisciplinary, dispersed, collaborative network composed of 33 humanities scholars investigating the Hispanic Baroque. Our findings suggest that project membership leads to greater network density and integration, without necessarily increasing the level of in-depth collaboration typically found in the sciences. Hence, collaborative models in the humanities, while increasingly important, are distinct from their counterparts in the sciences. The study provides a more nuanced view of networked scholarship because it demonstrates that large-scale collaborative projects can yield a high level of integration of the overall network, while at the same time allowing for strong thematic clustering. This dual structural process is relevant because not all network members can form dense relations with one another. Furthermore, we identified that principal investigators showed different networking strategies. © 2014 SAGE Publications",collaboration,communication behavior,digital humanities,interdisciplinary clusters,networked scholarship,social networks,,,Quan-Haase A.,Suarez J.L.,Brown D.M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Archaeological reports contain a great deal of information that conveys facts and findings in different ways. This kind of information is highly relevant to the research and analysis of archaeological evidence but at the same time can be a hindrance for the accurate indexing of documents with respect to positive assertions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a method for adapting the biomedicine oriented negation algorithm NegEx to the context of archaeology and discusses the evaluation results of the new modified negation detection module.

In this paper, I interrogate how specific ways of organising scholarly labour make possible certain forms of knowledge, and I study the obstacles scholars face when trying to adapt established organisational models. For this purpose I draw on fieldwork in a large European database project, launched to create empirical knowledge about “forgotten” women writers. Literary studies is characterised by monograph-oriented scholarship, situated in regional disciplinary contexts. The collaborative use of a database, however, requires an integration of individual research practices, and it blurs the division of labour between scholars and information professionals. In the present case, the inertia of established infrastructural arrangements manifested itself as a conflict between what was required to generate the specific type of knowledge the project aimed for, and the need for participants to engage in a more traditional form of knowledge production to advance their individual careers. The tension was better manageable in cases where the project conceded organisational authority to local contexts, an empirical finding with implications for established funding models for collaborative digital scholarship. © 2014, Taylor & Francis.",Database,Digital Humanities,Infrastructure,Literary Studies,Scholarly Labour,,,,Kaltenbrunner W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the 1990s, KCL's Department of Digital Humanities has been involved in the development of structured prosopographical databases using a general 'factoid-oriented' model of structure that links people to the information about them via spots in primary sources that assert that information. Recent developments, particularly the World Wide Web, and its related technologies around the Semantic Web, have promoted the possibility to both interconnecting dispersed data, and allowing it to be queried semantically. To the purpose of making available our prosopographical databases on the Semantic Web, in this article we review the principles behind our established factoid-based model and reformulate it using a more interoperable approach, based on knowledge representation principles and formal ontologies. In particular, we are going to focus primarily on a highlevel semantic analysis of the factoid notion, on its relation to other cultural heritage standards such as CIDOC-CRM, and on the modularity and extensibility of the proposed solutions. © The Author 2013.

We describe the 'Hidden Histories' pilot project and explore the origins and practice of oral history; in the corresponding issue of Digital Humanities Quarterly, five oral history interviews that we carried out during the project are presented. We conclude that the selection of interviews presented here demonstrate that oral history is an important and productive methodology in such research. The five oral history interviews form primary sources, which can be used in the writing of a history of computing in the humanities; furthermore, they contain new information and interpretations, which cannot be gleaned from published scholarly articles, for example, information about the varied entry routes into the field that have existed and the interrelationship between myth and history in the narratives we create about the emergence of digital humanities. © The Author 2013.

Conceptualizing the integration of digital humanities in instructional services: Possibilities to enhance digital literacy in the 21st century,9,10.1108/LHT-06-2014-0055,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84924425458&doi=10.1108%2fLHT-06-2014-0055&partnerID=40&md5=763f9b0cb670822d6e2d08d1d6b47626,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize how digital humanities (DH) projects can be integrated into instructional services programs in libraries. The paper draws on three digital projects from the New York Public Library (NYPL) and explores how librarians can creatively utilize these resources to teach new digital literacy skills such as data analysis and data management. For patrons, they can learn about the content of these crowd-sourcing projects as well. By integrating DH projects into library instruction, the possibilities and opportunities to expand and explore new research and teaching areas are timely and relevant. Design/methodology/approach – The approach of this paper is to explore NYPL’s three digital projects and underscore how they can be integrated into instructional services: “What’s On the Menu,” “Direct Me NYC” and “Map Warper” all offer strengths and limitations but they serve as paradigms to explore how digital resources can serve multipurpose use: they are databases, digital repositories and digital libraries but they can also serve as instructional service tools. Findings – The paper conceptualizes how three DH projects can serve as teaching opportunities for instructional services, particularly teaching digital literacy skills. By exploring the content of each digital project, the paper suggests that users can develop traditional information literacy skills but also digital literacy skills. In addition, as crowdsourcing projects, the Library also benefits from this engagement since users are adding transcriptions or rectified maps to the Library’s site. Patrons develop visual literacy skills as well. The paper addresses how librarians can meet the needs of the scholarly community through these new digital resources. While the paper only addresses the possibilities of these integrations, these ideas can be considered and implemented in any library. Practical implications – The paper addresses positive outcomes with these digital resources to be used for library instructional services. Based on these projects, the paper recommends that DH projects can be integrated into such instructions to introduce new content and digital skills if appropriate. Although, there are limitations with these digital resources, it is possible to maximize their usage if they are used in a different and creative way. It is possible for DH projects to be more than just digital projects but to act as a tool of digital literacy instruction. Librarians must play a creative role to address this gap. However, another limitation is that librarians themselves are “new” to these resources and may find it challenging to understand the importance of DH projects in scholarly research. Originality/value – This paper introduces DH projects produced in a public research library and explores how librarians can use these digital projects to teach patrons on how to analyze data, maps and other content to develop digital literacy skills. The paper conceptualizes the significant roles that these DH projects and librarians can play as critical mediators to introducing and fostering digital literacy in the twenty-first century. The paper can serve as an interest to academic and public libraries with large research collections and digital projects. By offering new innovative ideas of integrating DH into instructional services, the paper addresses how DH projects teaching tools can support specific digital skills such as visual literacy and data analysis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Academic libraries,Case Studies,Digital libraries,Library instruction,Research libraries,Skills training,,,Pun R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Developing Librarian training program created by and for librarians and professional staff in the Humanities and History division is a two-year training program to acquire new skills and methodologies to support the digital humanities. The program is based on the assumption that learning must happen in context; therefore the training is project based with all participants engaged in building a digital humanities research site as a team. This approach enables participants to learn about new tools in a sustained manner that parallels the way humanities researchers are likely to use them. Design/methodology/approach – In order to measure the success of achieving this goal, program designers defined three objectives: learn tools and methods that support the emerging research needs and trends in the humanities; create a more interesting and engaging work environment for librarians and professional staff; and engage effectively with the humanities research community across the University. Three methods/instruments were: Explicit Self-Reflections to assess what participants learned in each training unit; the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale to measure how participants feel about their work before and after the training program; and the Skill Set, Knowledge and Attitude Assessment to be administered at completion to measure the effectiveness of the training program as a whole. Findings – At the time of writing, the Developing Librarian Project is mid-way to completion, and implementation of the assessment plan is ongoing. Based on these self-reports, there is evidence that the training program has been effective, and participants have been successful in meeting most of the learning objectives identified in the units completed. While self-assessment of knowledge and skills may have its limitations, this technique is proving adequate and efficient for achieving the program’s goals. This method encourages experimentation and establishes failure as an important aspect of the learning process. Research limitations/implications – An assessment approach such as this does not measure the impact of training and development on digital humanities research, but initiates a valuable process,  highlighting skills gaps at the individual, and organizational levels. These data are important for identifying and implementing appropriate training opportunities for librarians supporting emergent research activities and for understanding what skills and professional  reparation are needed for new staff recruited into the organization. Originality/value – A successful training program should be benchmarked, evaluated in a substantive and systematic way, and improved continuously. A formal assessment plan, directly tied to clearly articulated objectives, helps assure that such a program is effectively evaluated, iteratively developed, and successfully implemented. The Developing Librarian Project provides a useful model of how an academic library can leverage assessment and evaluation processes to identify skills gaps and training needs and generate actionable data for improving staff learning. © Bakkalbasi, Jaggers&Rockenbach.",Assessment,Digital humanities,Professional development,Re-skilling,,,,,Bakkalbasi N.,Jaggars D.,Rockenbach B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific phrases (e.g., “war on terrorism”) powerfully predict a congressperson’s political ideology. The question addressed in this study is whether there is additional information that can be extracted from the indirect relations among words in large Senatorial speech databases. Given that direct co-occurrence of target words is a very low likelihood event, we focus on higher-order co-occurrence (e.g., whether two target words appear in similar semantic contexts), using the free software Contrast Analysis of Semantic Similarity (CASS) to compute individual differences (www.casstools.org). We describe how we used CASS in detail and provide a tutorial. Using text transcripts from 86 Senators, totaling over 150 million words, we demonstrate that CASS can account for political ideology above and beyond phrase counts. By complementing phrase count methods, CASS may be a useful method for the digital humanities and social sciences more generally. © The Author(s) 2014.",CASS,co-occurrence,political ideology,semantic space models,,,,,Holtzman N.S.,Kwong S.,Baird K.L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a framework derived from work in human geography and information science, we illustrate how there is more to place than names and coordinates. Through a set of case studies we explore different aspects of the seemingly trivial query ‘mountains in the Alps’ addressing a range of issues including ambiguity, the use of vernacular names, ways in which concepts such as mountain are used in different locations and by different groups, approaches to automatically generating macro-maps in space and time and, finally, techniques allowing regions to be characterised and compared based on the terms used to describe them. The use of all these methods in combination allows us to come closer to a meaningful representation of place in the sense of human geography within the context of Geographic Information Science. However, our approaches focus on the naming of places and their material or perceivable properties, and there is still much work to do to properly represent place, and particularly sense of place. Nonetheless, we suggest that such approaches have considerable potential for those working in the digital humanities, and especially those concerned with contributing to a spatial turn therein. © Edinburgh University Press",GIS,Locale,Macro-maps,Sense of place,Vernacular place names,,,,Purves R.S.,Derungs C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the nature of digital surrogacy is a substantial intellectual opportunity for archival science and the digital humanities, because of the increasing independence of surrogate collections from their archival sources. The paper presents an argument that one of the most significant requirements for the long-term access to collections of digital surrogates is to treat digital surrogates as archival records that embody traces of their fluid lifecycles and therefore are worthy of management and preservation as archives. It advances a theory of the archival nature of surrogacy founded on longstanding notions of archival quality, the traces of their source and the conditions of their creation, and the functional “work of the archive.” The paper presents evidence supporting a “secondary provenance” derived from re-digitization, re-ingestion of multiple versions, and de facto replacement of the original sources.

We encounter a much higher ratio of posts using humanities-related terms compared to their digital counterparts, suggesting a one-way dependency of digital humanities-related terms on the corresponding unprefixed labels. The results also show that the terms digital archive, digital literacy, and digital pedagogy are relatively independent from the respective unprefixed terms, and that digital publishing, digital libraries, and digital media show considerable cross-pollination between the specialization and the general noun. The topic modeling reproduces these findings and reveals further differences between the two platforms.

For example, it is typically practiced in larger collaborative projects that produce output very different from the traditional scholarly monograph. Digital humanists often present their work in strikingly reflexive accounts that are reminiscent of what science and technology studies scholars have called infrastructural inversion, a method that defamiliarizes the socio-material infrastructure of research to expose the inner workings of knowledge production. At first sight, infrastructural inversion might seem to constitute the opposite of the older concept of articulation work, which designates the situated activity of coordinating and managing cooperative work processes. It is more useful, however, to think about infrastructural inversion as a specific form of articulation work. The inversions performed by digital scholars serve to highlight and problematize established ways of streamlining articulation work, for example, through the established model of peer review, or by using conventional forms of scholarly output. In turn, such systematic defamiliarization opens up new and potentially competing ways of imagining the organization of articulation work. ©2014,Process Press.",articulation work,digital humanities,infrastructural inversion,,,,,,Kaltenbrunner W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the paper is to review the strategies used by Transcribe Bentham, a more mature crowdsourced electronic transcription project, with a view to informing the strategies put into place in the Estoria project, which has started transcribing using crowdsourcing more recently. The paper discusses the difficulties faced by crowdsourced electronic transcription projects and how these have been and are being resolved in these two projects. The difficulties discussed include the complexity of the palaeography involved, the necessity of tagging transcriptions using XML, the requirement to moderate and carry out quality-control of volunteer-produced transcriptions, and the creation of an atmosphere of camaraderie amongst staff-members and crowdsourcers, many of whom have never, and will never meet face-to-face. The findings may be useful for other collaborative electronic transcription projects and will inform and shape the way the Estoria project continues to use strategies to raise levels of recruitment and retention of crowdsourced transcribers.

While technology advances at a rapid pace, the sources of barriers and boundaries to extensive adoption in the humanities have remained the same. This panel brings together student, faculty, and professional speakers to examine key topics related to the role of information and technology in the development of research practices for, and about, the arts and humanities. Two core themes will be examined: 1) the importance of collaborative, cross-disciplinary programs, and, 2) the visibility afforded by technology and technology-based engagement allowing greater “impact” in arts and humanities disciplines. Within this context, panelists will discuss a collaborative interactive exhibit of library data, image classification of library collections using Flickr, engagement with digital methods, and an examination of altmetrics and current trends in research assessment. The current and potential impact of information and technology within the context of the arts and humanities is profound. Given the focus on cultural impediments and the need to foster a core set of e-based traditions in many disciplines, additional examination of the themes of collaboration and impact will help to define the continued importance of this topic within ASIS&T.

The substantial differences in the literary systems in both these eras', include the fact that the boundaries between system segments became porous during the digital revolution, and a clear process began whereby the individuakoles of action converged and the institutional aspect within the literary system was eliminated. Moreover the author focuses on a characterization of the three main processes. associated with the transition of literature from the pre-digital to the post-digital era: 1) expansion of the literary system; 2) destabilization of text; 3) vernacularization of literary culture. He concludes with a question over how to methodologically deal with the radically expanded literary system and the flood of text involved.

The discussion builds on recent debates in two overlapping fields. The first field argues that new modern communications media and technology have greatly fragmented the authority relationship in Islamic law; the second field centers on the perceived dissolution of the madhhab as a result of the widespread rejection of the authority of classical jurists. I argue that the same new media technology also provides a rationale and an instrument that enable Muslims to reformulate legal doctrines and revive the structure of legal authority as reflected in the school's tradition. By shifting the operation of the madhhab into cyberspace, these Sha¯fi'i¯ scholars have creatively responded to changes in communication technology and have effectively reformulated and refashioned the legal tradition of the madhhab as a practical reference for present-day Muslims. The ongoing presence of the madhhab, in this case, does not necessarily represent a zero sum game in the encounter with the legal reality of the modern nation-states. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2015.",authority,digital humanities,Islamic law in cyberspace,online fatwa¯,Sha¯fi'i¯ madhhab,,,,Halim F.A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ford's map contributes insights into further layers of colonial history, especially when combined in a geographic information system (GIS) with data from the Barbados Census of 1679 and modern elevation data. Settlement patterns were examined using the data of sugar mills from Ford's map with elevation and aspect information to determine whether there was a preference for building location. Further issues of artistic and realistic constraints on mapping accuracy were also examined. The accuracy of Ford's map comes into question when it is compared with the census of 1679. Ford's map claims to show every plantation on the island, but this is not verified by the census, which lists five times the number of planters. This deeper examination of the underutilized data from a printed map not only assesses the legitimacy of the map, both in terms of accuracy and of the claims set forth by their artists, but illustrates the discrepancy between the perceived completeness of the map and the abundance of narratives hidden in both it and other sources. © 2015 Peter Koby.",colonial Barbados,digital humanities,historical geography,historical GIS,sugar trade,,,,Koby P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beginning with the questions that led me to the project in the first place and concluding with my plans for expanding the project in the future, the article offers a roadmap of the trials and triumphs that come with digital humanities mapping projects. It also demonstrates the crucial role played by library resources - human, physical, and digital - in making this project a reality.

Playing with boundaries: Posthuman digital narratives in RealSelf.com,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929171202&partnerID=40&md5=caceb1ec566ac627ebcb057092bdb2ec,"Studies in digital humanities are often embedded in the theory of posthumanism. N. Katherine Hayles described the posthuman as ""an amalgam, a collection of heterogeneous components, a material-informational entity whose boundaries undergo continuous construction and reconstruction"" (Hayles, 1999, p. 3). Enmeshed in scientific advancements in communication technology and bio-technology, this posthuman body or cyborg is always in a state of perpetual becoming, with or without its own agency. Donna Harraway's ""Cyborg Manifesto"" (1991) celebrated the un-gendering potential of human-machine couplings. Internet theorists like Sherry Turkle (1997) have also expressed optimism about the self-changing capacity of digital communication. In this context, the paper interrogates, through a posthumanist lens, the digital narratives constructed through text and images on RealSelf.com, which is an online social media forum for those seeking (and finding) the correct cosmetic surgical treatment for human-enhancement or metamorphosis. The paper will attempt to read the website, especially selected transformation-stories from the ""Reviews"" section, where those who are undergoing/will undergo/have undergone cosmetic surgical procedures post their experiential narratives and photographs before, during and after the procedure in a blog-timeline format, often eliciting comments by supporting readers. These diverse narratives on the site may be unpacked to see how posthumans are playing with the boundaries of their bodies to reconstruct their selves, and whether these transformation-stories break away from earlier gender stereotypes, or whether they replicate them: old wine in a new, virtual, surgically-enhanced bottle? © Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities.",Cosmetic surgery,Cyborg,Digital,Human-enhancement,Narratives,Posthuman,Social media,,Sarkar S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nature of academic disciplines continues to change with time and notions of modernity. Inter-disciplinarity, or a shifting/dissolution/creation of disciplines reflect prevailing notions of modernity. It is in this background, that I plan to examine the rise of the digital humanities (henceforth referred to as DH), and the manner in which DH tries to place itself in a new form of modernity. Rather than looking at specific literary and cultural texts, I shall look at the nature of texts. The paper aims to show as to how DH has changed the way of thinking about texts and accessing texts. Rather than looking at a text as a linear narrative, DH opens up the possibility of visualising para-textual matter - matter not contained within the text itself but implied by it. In a way, DH also suggests a post-modern dissolution of the text itself - if the linear narrative is not more important than the para-textual matter, is the value of the text being undermined? This paper tries to conclude by connecting these implications of DH with the nature of how such suggestions of radicality justify the inclusion of DH as a marker of the 'modern moment' seeking to wilfully set itself against the past. © Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities.",,,,,,,,,Ghosh D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly, the series obtained are correlated to economic and development indicators in order to determine whether and how the cultural, economic, and social fields interact with each other. From the theoretical viewpoint, this project stands at the crossroad of several concepts: the literary field defined by Pierre Bourdieu (1972, 1980, 1992), knowledge domain analysis (Hjørland & Albrechtsen 1995; Hjørland 2001; Nascimento & Marteleto 2008), scientometrics (Price 1963; Garfield 1980, 2005; Leydesdorff 1998), and the recently emerged concept of big data (Berman 2013; Boyd & Crawford 2012; Mayer-Schönberger & Cukier 2013). Methodologically, aiming at quantitatively identifying the European national literatures, we base our research on scientometrics. Initially developed by Price (1963), the purpose of scientometrics is to measure and to analyze the scientific and technological activity. In this study, we adapt scientometric indicators to the architecture and features of the Modern Language Association International Bibliography. Thus, the elaboration of bibliometric indicators (Garfield 1980, 2005; Hjorland & Albrechtsen 1995) allowed us to obtain the number of bibliographic references dedicated to the study of each of the 48 European national literatures, making it possible for us tovisualize the importance of each of these literatures and to compare them to economic and social indicators. © Rupkatha Journal on Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities.",Bibliographic databases,Big data,Data mining,Digital humanities,Economic indicators,European literary field,Quantitative methods,Social indicators,Ferrer C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Copyright restrictions on material in collections of digitized text such as the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) necessitate providing facilities for non-consumptive reading, one of the approaches to which consists of providing users with features from the text in the form of small fragments of text, instead of the text itself. We argue that, contrary to expectation, the fragmentary quality of the features generated by the reading interface does not necessarily imply that the mode of reading enabled and mediated by these features points in an anti-humanist direction. We pose the fragmentariness of the features as paradigmatic of the fragmentation with which digital techniques tend, more generally, to trouble the humanities. We then generalize our argument to put our work on feature-based non-consumptive reading in dialogue with contemporary debates that are currently taking place in philosophy and in cultural theory and criticism about posthumanism and agency. While the locus of agency in such a non-consumptive practice of reading does not coincide with the customary figure of the singular human subject as reader, it is possible to accommodate this fragmentizing practice within the terms of an ampler notion of agency imagined as dispersed across an entire technosocial ensemble. When grasped in this way, such a practice of reading may be considered posthumanist but not necessarily antihumanist. © Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining 2015",Digital humanities,Digital libraries,Posthumanism,Text analysis,Textuality,,,,Bhattacharyya S.,Organisciak P.,Downie J.S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its extensibility it also serves as a development framework for knowledge intensive applications. On the surface, OntoWiki is a generic user interface for arbitrary RDF knowledge graphs. It supports the navigation through RDF knowledge bases using SPARQL-generated lists, tables and trees (e.g. class trees and taxonomies). All resources are automatically represented as hyperlinks and backlinks are created whenever feasible, thus enabling users to easily traverse entire knowledge graphs. Since all collections of resources displayed in OntoWiki are generated by SPARQL queries, they can be further refined by applying additional filters. In order to explore large datasets, a comprehensive statistical data management and visualization method was integrated. We render an architectural overview and explain the navigation, exploration and visualization features provided for RDF based information and derived statistics. To showcase the versatility of OntoWiki and its various deployments in the Linked Data Web, we describe some large-scale use cases in the domains of enterprise data integration, governmental data publication and digital humanities.

In this paper, we provide a bottom-up approach by analyzing geography dissertations. We start by assembling a database that includes the title, author, date, and university for every geographic doctoral dissertation written in the United States over the last 120 years. The database allows us to track the rise and fall of regions of interest and specific topics. It gives a broad overview of the different schools in geography and their influence within separate historical periods. And it permits a more empirically based delineation of geographical ""eras"" based on the commonality of words in dissertation titles. This work is at the convergence of the quantitative and qualitative; we quantify and visualize textual data to provide a more robust history of geography. The result is a new, more comprehensive way to look at the changing discipline of geography.

However, beyond simple measures of population and economic power, there has been no rigorous quantitative way to define the global influence of languages. Here we use the structure of the networks connecting multilingual speakers and translated texts, as expressed in book translations, multiple language editions of Wikipedia, and Twitter, to provide a concept of language importance that goes beyond simple economic or demographic measures. We find that the structure of these three global language networks (GLNs) is centered on English as a global hub and around a handful of intermediate hub languages, which include Spanish, German, French, Russian, Portuguese, and Chinese. We validate the measure of a language' s centrality in the three GLNs by showing that it exhibits a strong correlation with two independent measures of the number of famous people born in the countries associated with that language. These results suggest that the position of a language in the GLN contributes to the visibility of its speakers and the global popularity of the cultural content they produce. © 2014, National Academy of Sciences.

Hence, the question arises as to whether the history of education, as a field of study, has a future – or is it, as many authors have remarked, in danger? This article starts from the idea that our field of study is definitely not alone in its struggle: many branches of the humanities have fallen victim to similar appeals of economic efficiency and relevance. In response to these developments, digital humanities in particular have been identified as a way out of the impasse. Therefore, this article explores the ways in which digital humanities or digital history can offer valuable contributions to the future of the history of education. This paper advocates that, although digital humanities or digital history cannot magically make our problems disappear, historians of education should further embrace the possibilities digital technology has to offer for the investigation of our educational past. I argue that digital technology not only has the potential to make our lives considerably easier; it can also help in addressing new research questions, give new meaning to existing concepts within the history of education and further enhance the interdisciplinary character of our discipline. © 2014 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.",digital history,history of education,technology,,,,,,Van Ruyskensvelde S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These modes of interaction synthesize information traditionally available in different places (editions, facsimiles, translations, editorial commentary) to create new modes of interaction with digital manuscripts for students, scholars and the general public. The project has been developed using standard design practices from human-computer interaction, mindful of the implications of adapting such practices for a digital humanities domain. Engaging students in the design and implementation of these new tools has also created unique educational opportunities by raising fundamental questions about encoding practices and manuscript culture alike.

Pursuing automated classification of historic photographic papers from raking light images,24,10.1179/1945233014Y.0000000024,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907033734&doi=10.1179%2f1945233014Y.0000000024&partnerID=40&md5=db56dd5d5e8e55ecf912f076ebfe6a43,"Surface texture is a critical feature in the manufacture, marketing, and use of photographic paper. Raking light reveals texture through a stark rendering of highlights and shadows. Though close-up raking light images effectively document surface features of photographic paper, the sheer number and diversity of textures used for historic papers prohibits efficient visual classification. This work provides evidence that automatic, computer-based classification of texture documented with raking light is feasible by demonstrating an encouraging degree of success sorting a set of 120 images made from samples of historic silver gelatin paper. Using this dataset, four university teams applied different image-processing strategies for automatic feature extraction and degree of similarity quantification. All four approaches successfully detected strong affinities and outliers built into the dataset. The creation and deployment of the algorithms was carried out by the teams without prior knowledge of the distributions of similarities and outliers. These results indicate that automatic classification of silver gelatin photographic paper based on close-up texture images is feasible and should be pursued.

In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.",Big Data,computational social sciences,data analytics,data-driven science,digital humanities,end of theory,epistemology,paradigms,Kitchin R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the accessibility of the growing number of Big Data-capable technology solutions has often been the preserve of business analytics. Pay as you store/process services like Amazon Web Services have opened up possibilities for smaller scale Big Data projects. There is high demand for this type of research in the digital humanities and digital sociology, for example. However, scholars are increasingly finding themselves at a disadvantage as available data sets of interest continue to grow in size and complexity. Without a large amount of funding or the ability to form interdisciplinary partnerships, only a select few find themselves in the position to successfully engage Big Data.

Instead of just presenting a technical paper detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological debates in the social sciences and humanities. Design/methodology/approach–The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and epistemological plurality. Findings–The authors find that design decisions and more general methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building tools for computational social science or digital humanities. Practical implications–Besides methodological transparency, the software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Originality/value–The paper opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational work open for various epistemic sensibilities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Analysis,Computational social science,Data collection,Digital humanities,Digital methods,Twitter,,,Borra E.,Rieder B.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Web archiving aims to acquire, preserve and provide access to historical information published online. In April 2013, there were at least sixty four web archiving initiatives worldwide. Altogether, these archived collections of web documents form a comprehensive picture of our cultural, commercial, scientific and social history.

The framework encompasses a novel process, workflow and architecture. A working implementation has been produced and applied firstly to the publication of an existing social-sciences dataset, then to the harvesting and curation of a related dataset from an unstructured data-source. The framework's performance is evaluated using data quality measures that have been developed to measure existing published datasets. An analysis of the framework against these dimensions demonstrates that it addresses a broad range of real-world data quality concerns. Experimental results quantify the impact of the DaCura process and tools on data quality through an assessment framework and methodology which combines automated and human data quality controls.

This is because of the relationship that each cultural object has with the collections it is part of, with the memory institutions where it is held, with the other objects of the same nature and/or culturally connected with it, and the many other types of relationships that represent the real scientific value of the digitised cultural object (be it a book, an archival record, an artefact from a museum, a sound recording or a video). Further, the investment in the production of the digital cultural heritage data is extremely high because the description of each object requires the human intervention of experts in the sector in order to associate the necessary metadata. Automatic extraction of knowledge (metadata) from the digital representation of cultural items is still far from being at a production level. It is not yet commonly available or seamless to the cultural institutions that are engaged in the digitisation of their collections. In addition to the DCH content that derive from digitisation processes applied to the tangible heritage, also born digital cultural heritage is more and more a reality, particularly in the artistic scenario. Plastic artists are commonly using 3D modelling for their studies. Architects, writers, multimedia artists, graphic designers and almost all other artistic expressions produce data that need to be preserved for the researchers of today and for the future generations. Digital cultural data is therefore extremely precious and its preservation is more and more an imperative priority. This paper intends to discuss these matters in the light of the ongoing work carried out by the DCH-RP project (www.dch-rp.eu) funded by the European Commission. © Edinburgh University Press",archiving services,authentication and authorisation services,dark archive,Digital cultural heritage,digital cultural policy,digital curation,digital humanities,digital preservation,Fresa A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through the creation of communities of practice that bring together faculty, IT professionals, and students from across academic colleges and high performance computing groups that lay a foundation for collaboration, information systems scholars may realize new opportunities for behavioral, design science, business intelligence, and IS strategy research.

In the process, Kipling emerges as a more transatlantic poet than was previously thought, and as a figure who is more influential in America. He is seen to have a sophisticated understanding of the demands and nature of newsprint, of newspapers as a literary and poetic medium, and of newspaper poetry as a journalistic genre.

It argues that scholars must first determine how the artifact participates in the life of its community. If this participation is integral, scholars should treat the artifact as a present-day cultural phenomenon, inseparable from its community. To explain the implications of this shift, the author turns to ethnography, which has a lengthy tradition of interacting with communities for generating research. Photographing a sacred artifact is not unlike other ethnographic research, whether tape recording stories, collecting documents, or gathering information about social practices. To guide digital work, the essay proposes ethnographic ethical principles, demonstrating their value in digitizing the 8th-century St Chad Gospels at Lichfield Cathedral, England-supporting Jamie Bianco's recent call for an ""ethical turn"" in the digital humanities. © 2014 Brill.

Digital humanities is a growing scholarly domain, defi nitions of which vary but which generally involves the application of computers to research questions that fall within the traditional remit of the humanities. It includes many areas of research that overlap with publishing. An important aspect of digital humanities is therefore to question assumptions that digital publishing should produce faithful visual reproductions. We argue that this cannot be the only objective of digital humanities publishing, and rather that publishing needs to be understood as a range of modelling activities that aim to develop and communicate interpretations, whether consciously or not.

The iconography in the digital era: Towards a heuristic for studying the content of medieval images,0,10.7203/MCLM.1.3796,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85035315902&doi=10.7203%2fMCLM.1.3796&partnerID=40&md5=6143bf262f64bed2b3c64ac06789924e,"This article invites us to consider the usefulness of iconography as a method to describe the subjects represented in medieval works of art. In this study, a greater emphasis has been put on investigating the epistemological implications resulting from the use of that method, and the biases that may appear in the process of transforming images into words. The aim is to address what has been called the “semantic gap”, i.e., a kind of barrier that prevents the verbal representation of a non-lexical medium, such as the visual one, in a satisfactory and undiminished way. After a brief panorama of image theory throughout the classical era, with especial reference to the rhetorical genre of ekphrasis, this study suggests that, beneath the apparent balance between the verbal and the visual media, a rivalry persists. Later on, in medieval times, a mutation occurs in the way we perceive the visual arts and the images start being considered as texts that can be read. Thanks to the prejudice implied by the statement that we can only attain knowledge through words, the image is relegated to a decorative role or, at the most, an instrument of evangelisation of the illiterate. In the discipline of medieval art history, defective uses of iconography have led to question its validity as a tool for analysis, even after the systematizing task endeavoured by Erwin Panofsky. Iconography, however, has gained new momentum thanks largely to the creation of digital collections that require iconographic principles to facilitate the recovery of visual documents. The new technologies, however, have accentuated the semantic gap between image and word, and nuanced the value of iconography, combined with indexing techniques based on controlled vocabularies and thesauri. In addition, a critical survey has been made of the most interesting projects which have undertaken the task of indexing the medieval art. Finally, it is argued that migration of iconography into the Web can be the hard core that allows medieval art history to step forward and fully enter into the domain of digital humanities. © 2014, Universitat de Valencia.

One of the defining moments in the field was a shift in focus from comparing a source text with its translation to looking at the translation in a target culture. Another development that is growing in importance is a focus on the translator and how other individuals may use their agency to influence the final textual product as well as its packaging and reception. To this end, the theoretical concepts of Pierre Bourdieu, particularly that of the habitus of the translator, and that of the Actor-Network Theory have been applied to analyze and trace the development of translation products, the individuals involved in the process, as well as the discourse which surrounds the reception of translations. This article sets out to apply these theoretical and methodological apparatuses to the early titles of Japanese literature in English translation which appeared in the 1950s. The findings suggest the agency construct is supported by the concept of habitus and by Actor-Network Theory. The articulation of new data provided by publisher archives in turn helps to clarify the historical place of these translations. © 2014 Oriental Institute (ASCR), Prague.",Actor-network theory,Agency,Digital humanities,Habitus,Japanese literature in English translation,,,,Walker L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modernity has led us to “believe” in the existence of “works” and “ideas” independently of their concrete expressions in the supports of writing. Such beliefs have deeply influenced modern methodologies, and among them the biblical methodological approaches. The digital revolution reminds one to take a humble attitude to our ideas, and also to our attachment to literary “works”, paying attention to the texts as documents and objects. Starting from this general idea, this article considers first the impact of some modern beliefs on Classical studies. The second part of this article argues that digital culture can particularly help us to rediscover a culture with plural literacies. Finally, this article asks if the New Testament is becoming a biblaridion (Revelation 10:2, 9-10), a “very small booklet”, lost in the World Wide Web, losing more and more of its covers and becoming potentially a “liquid book”, as described by Jacques Derrida (Adema, 2012).

Here I argue that Choueka’s old question, “The tools are here; where are the results?”, similarly directs humanist scholars to pay attention first to development of theory rather than to the features of software. For those who know where to look, the results we do have are hardly unimpressive, but to argue their importance requires a new understanding of both theory and practice. The problem scholars face is twofold: first to develop a computational discourse adequate to the best artefactual theories we have; second to reconceive their computational practices as a matter of tooling rather than tool-use. For computer science the biggest challenge is to understand and implement dynamical scholarly practices as they metamorphose from one temporary state to the next. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.",Culture,Digital humanities,Metamorphosis,Model systems,Modelling,Results,Text-analysis,Textual theory,McCarty W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, the requirements include preparation of information for the description of resources providing a source for metadata harvesting, registration of persistent identifiers for the long-term access and citeability of resources, implementation of a federated content search module, dealing with privacy restrictions, and the possibility to provide a single sign-on method via Shibboleth.

Prism was developed by two discrete teams of 1-year fellows with the Scholars' Lab and is freely available at http://prism.scholarslab.org. This article describes Prism's intervention into current crowdsourcing debates. First, we demonstrate that where other crowdsourcing projects have tended to ask users to compile data or perform other mechanistic tasks such as optical character recognition correction or manuscript transcription, Prism enables community-generated interpretation along discrete parameters. In addition, we describe how Prism challenges two common approaches to crowdsourcing in the digital humanities that are characterized as microtasking and macrotasking. We also explore the ways in which Prism's user interface and design respect the role of the individual in crowdsourcing and how future developments of the tool might expand on these possibilities. © The Author 2014.

This short article examines the human and machinic operations obscuring Judy Malloy's Uncle Roger, a hypertext that predates afternoon. Malloy's reputation was stunted because Uncle Roger was algorithmically invisible, a factor that became increasingly important as the Web's commercial capacities matured. afternoon's endurance can be traced to its ISBN, which made afternoon easy for readers to find and united disparate stewards in preserving access to this work. Malloy's programming expertise and the goodwill among hypertext authors were insufficient to protect her against sexist exclusions that, in aggregate, fostered enduring disequilibria. While some male pioneers of hypertext are now full professors, Malloy and other early female hypertext pioneers are adjuncts or are otherwise at a remove from the academic power base. Ironically, Judy Malloy's papers-13,200 items, 15.6 linear feet-are collected at Duke University's Rubenstein Library, but Judy herself still seeks sustained academic employment. This gesture is read in the context of pursuing the digital humanities 'for love' in a higher education environment that's increasingly neoliberal in its financial allegiances. © The Author 2014.

In regard to multi-authored papers the statistically significant increases are more wideranging in AAAG than in either LLC or CHum, with increases in all forms of multi-authorship.

Web-based discovery and integration of archaeological historic properties inventory data: The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA),22,10.1093/llc/fqu028,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906847511&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqu028&partnerID=40&md5=d069e9339545b36b75fd02c442255d2a,"Integrating data from different sources represents a tremendous research opportunity across the humanities, social, and natural sciences. However, repurposing data for uses not imagined or anticipated by their creators involves conceptual, methodological, and theoretical challenges. These are acute in archaeology, a discipline that straddles the humanities and sciences. Heritage protection laws shape archaeological practice and generate large bodies of data, largely untapped for research or other purposes. The Digital Index of North American Archaeology (DINAA) project adapts heritage management data sets for broader open and public uses. DINAA's initial goal is to integrate government-curated public data from off-line and online digital repositories, from up to twenty US states, and which qualitatively and quantitatively describe over 500,000 archaeological sites in eastern North America. DINAA hopes to promote extension and reuse by government personnel, as well as by domestic and international researchers interested in the cultures, histories, artifacts, and behaviors described within these public data sets. DINAA innovatively applies methodologies and workflows typical of many 'open science' and digital humanities programs to these data sets. The distributed nature of data production, coupled with protections for sensitive data, add layers of complexity. Ethically negotiating these issues can wider the collaboration between stakeholder communities, and offer an unprecedented new view on human use of the North American landscape across vast regions and time scales. © The Author 2014.

Realizing lessons of the last 20 years: A manifesto for data provisioning & aggregation services for the digital humanities (a position paper),30,10.1045/july2014-oldman,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905717331&doi=10.1045%2fjuly2014-oldman&partnerID=40&md5=029ffb595d92e5028d17cea9478cc922,"The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM), is a semantically rich ontology that delivers data harmonisation based on empirically analysed contextual relationships rather than relying on a traditional fixed field/value approach, overly generalised relationships or an artificial set of core metadata. It recognises that cultural data is a living growing resource and cannot be commoditised or squeezed into artificial pre-conceived boxes. Rather, it is diverse and variable containing perspectives that incorporate different institutional histories, disciplines and objectives. The CIDOC CRM retains these perspectives yet provides the opportunity for computational reasoning across large numbers of heterogeneous sources from different organisations, and creates an environment for engaging and thought-provoking exploration through its network of relationships. The core ontology supports the whole cultural heritage community including museums, libraries and archives and provides a growing set of specialist extensions. The increased use of aggregation services and the growing use of the CIDOC CRM has necessitated a new initiative to develop a data provisioning reference model targeted at solving fundamental infrastructure problems ignored by data integration initiatives to date. If data provisioning and aggregation are designed to support the reuse of data in research as well as general end user activities then any weaknesses in the model that aggregators implement will have profound effects on the future of data centred digital humanities work. While the CIDOC CRM solves the problem of quality and delivering semantically rich data integration, this achievement can still be undermined by a lack of properly managed processes and working relationships between data providers and aggregators. These relationships hold the key to sustainability and longevity because done properly they encourage the provider to align their systems, knowing that the effort will provide long lasting benefits and value. Equally, end user projects will be encouraged to cease perpetuating the patchwork of short-life digital resources that can never be aligned and which condemn the digital humanities to a pseudo and predominantly lower quality discipline. © 2014 Dominic Oldman, Martin Doerr, Gerald de Jong, Barry Norton and Thomas Wikman.",,,,,,,,,Oldman D.,Doerr M.,de Jong G.,Norton B.,Wikman T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The best known format for an IGT is the one found in linguistic publications, where one line of text is followed by one line of glosses and one line of free translation. Although used in different functions, IGTs are ubiquitous in linguistic research and publications. Yet they also have been criticised for being fabricated and unreliable in some of their uses. However that might be, IGTs represent linguistic knowledge, and in particular for less-resourced languages, they are not rarely the only structured data available. Under the auspices of the Digital Humanities, linguists increasingly focus on the advantages of Semantic Web technologies. Presenting the modules and procedures of the web-based linguistic application TypeCraft (TC), we outline how the creation of IGTs can become an integral part of a shared linguistic methodology. Linguistic services have the potential of allowing efficient data management, and their strength lies in facilitating new forms of collaboration beyond social networking. They pave the way towards what one might call shared methodologies. In this paper we would like to discuss the linguistic value of web-based technology. By presenting the functionalities of TC and giving a detailed summary of online linguistic data creation and retrieval, we will present external and internal criteria for a single system evaluation of TC centred on usage objectives. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Digital Humanities,IGT,Language data management,Shared linguistic methodologies,Single system usage evaluation,Web-based linguistic tools,,,Beermann D.,Mihaylov P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qualitative and mixed-methods approaches with GIS value the suite of spatial methods and technologies, while typically showing a marked sensitivity toward issues of subjectivity, knowledge production, exclusion, reflexivity, and power relations. Although recent research in the use of qualitative GIS demonstrates the ways in which spatial representations and analyses can be used as part of critical geographic inquiry, there remain significant opportunities to demonstrate and synthesize the particular affordances of these approaches. Alongside broader developments in public scholarship and the digital humanities, mixed-methods research with GIS is coming of age, as technological innovations are easing access to data and access to visualization and analytical tools for some. The implications of these developments at the level of knowledge construction within community-based, critical research have been underexplored, however. What are the specific affordances of mixed-methods research with GIS? How are mixed-methods knowledges made and worked through community engagement? Here, we trace how qualitative GIS methods uniquely enable multiple narratives to change the ways in which GIS is practiced. To illustrate this process, we present findings from the use of qualitative GIS to study urban gardening in a postindustrial, Midwestern city. © 2014 © 2014 by Association of American Geographers.",critical GIS,qualitative GIS,urban gardening,urban geography,,,,,Preston B.,Wilson M.W.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas the UNESCO YouTube videos posted on the online representative list freeze intangible heritage (often in accordance with nationalist aims of current governments), the proliferation of user-generated YouTube videos of the very practices officially safeguarded potentially re-enacts heritage as it changes and takes on new shapes. This possibility is based upon YouTube’s status as a new archival structure that transmits information through video content that produces narratives as well as through algorithms that generate lists.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow for complex spatial analysis of 2.5D data. For example, they offer bird's eye views of landscapes with extruded building footprints, but one cannot 'get on the ground' and interact with true 3D models from a pedestrian perspective. Meanwhile, 3D models and virtual environments visualize data in 3D space, but analytical tools are simple rotation or lighting effects. The MayaArch3D Project is developing a 3D WebGIS-called QueryArch3D-to allow these two distinct approaches to 'talk to each other' for studies of architecture and landscapes-in this case, the eighth-century Maya kingdom of Copan, Honduras. With this tool, researchers can search and query, in real time via a virtual reality (VR) environment, segmented 3D models of multiple resolutions (as well as computer-assisted design and realitybased) that are linked to attribute data stored in a spatial database. Beta tests indicate that this tool can assist researchers in expanding questions and developing new analytical methods in humanities research. This article summarizes the results of a pilot project that started in 2009, with an art historian and an archaeologist's collaborative research on the ancient Maya kingdom and UNESCO World Heritage site of Copan in Honduras-called MayaArch3D. The projectresearches innovative approaches to integrate GIS, 3D digital models, and VR environments online for teaching and research on ancient architecture and landscapes. It has grown into an international, interdisciplinary project that brings together art historians, archaeologists, and cultural resource managers with experts in remote sensing, photogrammetry, 3D modeling, and VR. The Start Up Phase was funded by two National Endowment for the Humanities, Digital Humanities Start-Up grants to the University of New Mexico (PI: Jennifer von Schwerin) and developed and beta tested a pipeline and prototype 3D WebGIS- called QueryArch3D. The prototype version is available at http://mayaarch3d.org/ project-history/). Project results indicate that it is possible to bridge the gap between 3D and GIS to create a resource for researchers of Maya architecture to compare and analyze 3D models and archaeological data in the context of a geographically referenced, VR landscape. © The Author 2013.

While some of the basic activities that the scholars do, such as reading and writing papers, are already well supported in the digital world, some essential scholarly primitives, such as annotation, augmentation, contextualization, and externalization, do not yet have clear support in terms of software tools. What scholars ultimately do during their research activity is to iteratively and collaboratively create new knowledge. With the advent of the Digital Humanities, we now have the opportunity-and technology-to capture at least a part of this knowledge and make it available as machine-processable data so to be better explorable and discoverable. In this paper, we present and discuss Pundit: a novel semantic annotation tool that enables scholars to collect, annotate, and contextualize Web resources. Deep-linking is used in conjunction with an RDFbased data model to allow granular selection of content (e.g. text excerpts, image fragments). Pundit aims at enabling scholars to produce meaningful machinereadable data that captures the semantics of their annotations. By providing a customizable annotation environment, where domain specific vocabularies can be loaded, and easy ways of integrating with existing Web archives or libraries, Pundit enables users to publish their annotations and collaboratively build a semantic graph. Such a graph can be consumed via HTTP APIs and standard SPARQL, thus allowing existing Linked Data applications to easily work with the data and Web clients in general to build specific visualizations. © The Author 2013.

We want to understand the relationships between dimensions of data, but lack flexible techniques for exploration beyond low-order relationships. Current visual techniques for multidimensional data analysis focus on binary conjunctive relationships between dimensions. Recent techniques, such as cross-filtering on an attribute relationship graph, facilitate the exploration of some higher-order conjunctive relationships, but require a great deal of care and precision to do so effectively. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the expressive power of existing visual querying systems and describes a more flexible approach in which users can explore n-ary conjunctive inter-and intra-dimensional relationships by interactively constructing queries as visual hypergraphs. In a hypergraph query, nodes represent subsets of values and hyperedges represent conjunctive relationships. Analysts can dynamically build and modify the query using sequences of simple interactions. The hypergraph serves not only as a query specification, but also as a compact visual representation of the interactive state. Using examples from several domains, focusing on the digital humanities, we describe the design considerations for developing the querying system and incorporating it into visual analysis tools. We analyze query expressiveness with regard to the kinds of questions it can and cannot pose, and describe how it simultaneously expands the expressiveness of and is complemented by cross-filtering. © 2013 IEEE.",attribute relationship graphs,digital humanities,graph query language,Graph search,higher-order conjunctive queries,multidimensional data,multivariate data analysis,visual query language,Shadoan R.,Weaver C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stanley Hall. Using the methods of the increasingly popular digital humanities, some key attributes of the American Journal of Psychology (AJP) and the Pedagogical Seminary (PS) are identified. Our analysis reaffirms some of Hall's explicit aims for the two periodicals, while also revealing a number of other features of the journals, as well as of the people who published within their pages, the methodologies they employed, and the institutions at which they worked. Notably, despite Hall's intent that his psychological journal be strictly an outlet for scientific research, the journal-like its sister pedagogically focused publication-included an array of methodologically diverse research. The multiplicity of research styles that characterize the content of Hall's journals in their initial years is, in part, a consequence of individual researchers at times crossing methodological lines and producing a diverse body of research. Along with such variety within each periodical, it is evident that the line between content appropriate to one periodical rather than the other was fluid rather than absolute. The full results of this digitally informed analysis of Hall's two journals suggest a number of novel avenues for future research and demonstrate the utility of digital methods as applied to the history of psychology. © 2013 American Psychological Association.",Data visualization,Digital history,G.

By ""computational journalism"" the article refers to the increasingly ubiquitous forms of algorithmic, social scientific, and mathematical forms of newswork adopted by many 21st-century newsrooms and touted by many educational institutions as ""the future of news."" By ""sociological approach,"" the article endorses a research model that brackets, at least temporarily, many of the current industry concerns with the practical usability of newsroom analysis. The bulk of the article outlines a series of six lenses through which such an approach to computational journalism might be carried out.

Drawing on the experiences made in developing innovative 'big data' approaches to social media research, this paper examines some of the repercussions for the scholarly research and publication practices of those researchers who do pursue the path of 'big data'-centric investigation in their work. As researchers import the tools and methods of highly quantitative, statistical analysis from the 'hard' sciences into computational, digital humanities research, must they also subscribe to the language and assumptions underlying such 'scientificity'? If so, how does this affect the choices made in gathering, processing, analysing, and disseminating the outcomes of digital humanities research?

The idea of global Shakespeares has caught on because of site-specific imaginations involving early modern and modern Globe theatres that aspired to perform the globe. Seeing global Shakespeares as a methodology rather than as appendages of colonialism, as political rhetorics, or as centerpieces in a display of exotic cultures situates us in a postnational space that is defined by fluid cultural locations rather than by nation-states. This framework helps us confront archival silences in the record of globalization, understand the spectral quality of citations of Shakespeare and mobile artworks, and reframe the debate about cultural exchange. Global Shakespeares as a field registers the shifting locus of anxiety between cultural particularity and universality.

While every medieval manuscript is an individual entity, displaying a series of unique and unrepeatable material, structural and aesthetic characteristics, digital devices are able to generate only twodimensional photographic reproductions. However, the digital medium brings about some major improvements in the study - and teaching - of medieval manuscripts because the hypertextual nature of its applications allows us to analyze synchronic and the diachronic dynamics simultaneously. From a theoretical point of view, the difference between the state of the manuscript taken as a material object and its status as a vector of intellectual values brings to light similarities between the notions of intellectual property and originality in traditional print and digital cultures. The increasing number of critical editions of medieval texts and manuscripts in digital form asks us to reshape the theoretical and conceptual-linguistic frameworks of textual criticism as a discipline.

The encyclopedia and encyclopedic literature comprise and announce such strategies as metadata, collaborative authorship, and transliteracy. Further, Martens elaborates on new conceptions of connectivity, conversity, and interoperability as hallmarks of transliteracy within digital humanities.

By blending the theoretical and methodological concerns of folkloristics, gender studies, and large-scale scientific research, this article demonstrates the utility of cross-disciplinary collaboration in asking traditional questions of traditional materials with new methods. To facilitate this research, a hand-coded database listing every reference to a body or body part in the 233 fairy tales was created. Analysis revealed strong indications that the gender and age of fairy-tale protagonists correlate in ways that indicate societal value being placed on certain perspectives, with youthful and masculine perspectives being validated as universal, whereas feminine and aged bodies are often marked as 'other'. Feminist scholars have articulated some of these ideas in the past, and this approach allows for a more empirical exploration of such claims. © The Author 2012.

We adapt several techniques, which have proven useful for author identification to the problem of identifying an individual author's Myers-Briggs personality type indicator fro the statistical features of the text. The Myers-Briggs type indicator assigns four binary classifications to define personality type: Extrovert-Introvert, Intuitive-Sensing, Thinking-Feeling, and Judging-Perceiving. For this study, we use the Personae corpus, which consists of 14 Dutch-language texts all pertaining to a specific topic, each labeled with the Myers-Briggs personality profile of the author (Luyckx K and Daelemans W, Personae: A Corpus for Author and Personality Prediction from Text, In Proceedings of the 6th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.

It uses, among others, the example of the author's PhD dissertation currently in process, which is set up as a theoretical and practical intervention into existing discourses surrounding the dominant form of formal communication within the humanities: the scholarly monograph. A methodology of critical praxis is seen as an integral part of the research project as well as an important step in developing academic or research literacy through actively engaging in the production of communicative norms and practices. Envisioning the book as a site of struggle over new forms and systems of communication within academia, the dissertation argues for alternative ways of thinking of and performing the monograph in an experimental manner. By making use of digital platforms, tools and media to share, remix and update the research as it evolves, the aim is to develop a digital, open and collaborative research practice. This will offer a practical critique of the dominant structures, politics and practices of producing and distributing research results. This article thus argues for the empowering potential of critically analysing and actively engaging with the dominant norms underlying communication in the humanities as well as with the structures that determine academic literacy and the established and accepted practices herein. By arguing for a potential new future for the book within scholarly communication as an emergent and evolving form, based on accessibility, sharing, process and change, this article makes a case for new ways of engaging a critical praxis that is more speculatory, open-ended and experimental. © The Author(s) 2013.",(digital) humanities,critical praxis,open research,PhD dissertation,remix,scholarly monograph,,,Adema J.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kress Foundation, in conjunction with the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media at George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, sponsored a survey of the art history community to clarify the field's perceptions about digital art history and its impact on the discipline. The findings reveal uncertainty among community members about the value and role of digital art history and a reticence to embrace it as an emerging aspect of the discipline. The reasons for the uncertainty are embedded in the culture and tradition of art historical research, in infrastructure limitations, in digitization and access challenges, and in concerns about online publishing. Guiding the discipline toward greater acceptance of digital scholarship will require incisive action, starting with greater dialogue across the community about what art history should be in the twenty-first century, and the role that digital art history will play in that scenario. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Art History,Art History Research Centers,Digital Art History,Digital Humanities,Digital Humanities Centers,Digital Scholarship,Samuel H.

Yet while the reports are each distinct, they collectively are highly repetitive and remarkably unaffected by either the context in which they were written or the policies pursued by governments. The consistency of the texts over sixteen years of transformation in government indicates that such institutional discourse is slow to change, demonstrating a strong ""bond"" to what had been reported previously.

The first fruits of the French Book Trade in Enlightenment Europe project, a digital humanities initiative that has created an on-line database revealing the STN's entire trade, this article challenges Darnton's interpretation of the nature and utility of the Neuchâtel archive. It demonstrates that the STN's order books are an unreliable gauge of general French demand. It goes further.

Methodology/approach - A review focuses on concepts of materiality, agency, and intention that mark a shift to a relational metaphysics in consumption contexts. Drawing from design theory, digital humanities, and philosophy, notions of flickering and witnessing evoke models of relations and interactions between consumers and consumption objects. Findings - In this chapter, a disciplinary proposition emerges: consumer research is a form of materiality studies wherein the consumer is designated an element of interest in the relationships and interactions that bring forth the world. Research implications - An awareness of the fundamental role played in consumer research by materiality-related assumptions may inspire concomitant animation and explication of a relational metaphysics, opening opportunities to recognize processes and practices at the core of consumer behavior previously obscured by prevailing interpretations governed by a singularly agentic, autonomous, and effective human subject. Power relations must not be ignored. Originality/value of chapter - The chapter makes several contributions: organizes and explicates often taken for granted concepts such as materiality, materialism, and agency, connects consumer research to high-level theorizations of materiality, and synthesizes diverse discussions in consumer culture theory with the possibilities of new materialities. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Consumer culture theory,Consumer identity,Materiality,Philosophy and consumption,Subjectivity,,,,Borgerson J.L.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At base, the production and dissemination of documents has been greatly augmented by computer technology. The development of multimedia and hypertext methods has, furthermore, allowed for multimodal presentation of information that has enhanced our cognitive appraisal and assimilation of materials produced by scholars working in these ""liberal arts"" fields. Much of the discussion concerning the impact of computer technology upon humanities disciplines has taken place under the rubric of ""digital humanities"". This article argues that a new methodological paradigm is emerging in fields such as English and history that accommodates not only what commonly falls under ""digital humanities"", but also includes endeavors that encompass cognitive and algorithmic/computational approaches. For example, theorists (such as David Herman, Lisa Zunshine, Patrick Colm Hogan and Ellen Spolsky) who work in departments of English have taken inspiration from research currently done on human cognition to help interpret literary texts from the standpoint of psychology and neuroscience. From a computational perspective, an interpretive approach that uses statistical and graph-theoretic methods to analyze texts has been advocated by Franco Moretti and his colleagues at Stanford University. I will argue that these three approaches-digital humanities, cognitive humanities and algorithmic/ computational humanities-have distinctive claims that can also complement and intersect with each other. Taken together they represent an emerging methodological paradigm for the humanities.",Cognition and the humanities,Computational,Computers and the humanities,Digital humanities,Emerging trends,Humanities,,,Vampola D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the dominant North American port during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, in a plantation region with an African American population majority from the early 1700s into the mid-1900s, comprehensively acknowledging and representing African American history in ""Historic Charleston"" is long overdue. For over a decade, developers of the International African American Museum (IAAM) have worked to address this glaring oversight in Charleston and the Lowcountry region, but they relied predominantly on funding from the federal government to launch this eighty million dollar project. In 2010, IAAM lost twenty-five million dollars of federal start-up support due to the economic downturn, which forced the museum board to reassess their development strategies. The result is a new design and implementation plan that suggests a significantly downsized museum building, but also introduces a range of innovative uses of various physical and virtual spaces throughout the Charleston area for implementing an influential African American history museum. This paper presents a case study of IAAM's fluctuating development process, with a particular focus on outlining these new, more cost-effective development strategies, which include: collaborating with existing historic tourism sites to improve their African American history representations; operating as a trailhead to inclusive history sites in the region; developing digital interpretation projects such as online tours, interactive maps, and online exhibitions; and interpreting the landscape around the museum, rather confining interpretation to the interior of the building. © Common Ground, Mary Battle, All Rights Reserved.",African American Museum,Charleston,Cultural heritage,Digital humanities,Economic downturn,Historic tourism,South Carolina,,Battle M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Design/methodology/approach: To study this, learners will use GeoStoryteller to learn about a historical topic on the places where significant events occurred, and then be interviewed by the researchers. GeoStoryteller is a tool developed by the researchers that runs on smartphones, such as an iPhone or Android. It provides the user multimedia stories about the historical sites, delivered via the mobile web or through Layar, an augmented reality web browser. The initial application of this technology focuses on German immigration to New York City between 1840 and 1945 through a partnership with the Goethe-Institut, the Federal Republic of Germany's cultural institution. After using GeoStoryteller to learn about this content, n=31 participants were interviewed by the researchers, and transcripts were subjected to a quantitative content analysis. Findings: Results indicate that the use of place increases learner perceptions of their engagement and understanding of historical topics; however, novel user interfaces like augmented reality impose significant usability issues, and more standard interfaces are preferred by users. Originality/value: The use of place in mobile learning environments provides a meaningful entry point into historical content.

We also address the problem of efficiently encoding multi-structured documents by introducing MultiX, a new XML formalism based on the MSDM model.

To create a successful product that would be useful to bindings researchers, it addressed questions of bindings terminology and the role of the library in the knowledge creation process within the context that text encoding is changing the landscape of library functions. Text encoding formats were examined, and a basic TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) transcription was produced. This facilitates tagging of names and titles and the display of transcriptions with text images. Findings: Encoding was found not only to make the manuscript content more accessible, but to allow for the construction of new knowledge: characteristic Oxford binding traits were revealed and bindings were matched to binders. Plans for added functionality were formed. Originality/value: This research presents a ""big picture"" analysis of Oxford bindings as a result of text encoding and the foundation for qualitative and statistical analysis. It exemplifies the benefits of interdisciplinary methods - in this case from Digital Humanities - to enhance access to and interpretation of specialist materials and the library's provenance record. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Books,Digital documents,History,Libraries,Research libraries,,,,McCarthy E.,Welsh A.,Wheale S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Organized by Ann Ardis and Patrick Collier, the conference assembled a diverse group of researchers from several fields, whose breadth of scholarship proved essential to encompassing the sprawling, overlapping, and transnational nature of modernist periodical networks. The symposium continued work begun by its 2007 predecessor ""Transatlantic Print Culture, 1880-1940: Emerging Media, Emerging Modernisms,"" while also offering a welcome forum for new scholarship. Speakers were organized into nine panels over two days, and the weekend concluded with an open-forum discussion held over dinner and drinks. The conference was accompanied by a print exhibit Mediamorphosis: Periodical across the Pond curated by Mark Samuels Lasner and Timothy D. Murray, which featured rare periodicals drawn from the University of Delaware's special collections. The organizers scheduled no concurrent panels, and as a result participants developed a shared context for discussing current and future concerns in periodical research. These discussions pursued the roles of digital humanities in print culture research; relationships between mass culture and marginal publics; the politics of bridging global and local concerns in periodical circulation, layout, and content; and finally, questions of attribution and ownership. This review offers an overview of the conference and some key papers, situating the scholarship on display within broader discussions about institutional responses to more expansive approaches to print culture and emerging research methodologies.

Complexity science should be the next step. Even though much of the ground-breaking work in complexity science has been done in the natural sciences and mathematics, it can, if critically adapted, provide the needed metaphor for a broad integration of disciplines, humanistic and otherwise. Given its almost a-disciplinary nature, a complexity approach to the research problems in the humanities necessarily breaks down silos.

Digitization of paper documents is motivated by the aim of preserving cultural heritage and making it more accessible, both to laypeople and scholars. As digital images cannot be searched for text, digitization projects increasingly strive to create digital text, which can be searched and otherwise automatically processed, in addition to facsimiles. Indeed, the emerging field of digital humanities heavily relies on the availability of digital text for its studies. Together with the increasing availability of historical texts in digital form, there is a growing interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) methods and tools to historical texts. However, the specific linguistic properties of historical texts the lack of standardized orthography in particular pose special challenges for NLP. This is book aims to give an introduction to NLP for historical texts and an overview of the state of the art in this field. The book starts with an overview of methods for the acquisition of historical texts (scanning and OCR), discusses text encoding and annotation schemes, and presents examples of corpora of historical texts in a variety of languages. The book then discusses specific methods, such as creating part-of-speech taggers for historical languages or handling spelling variation. A final chapter analyzes the relationship between NLP and the digital humanities. Certain recently emerging textual genres, such as SMS, social media, and chat messages, or newsgroup and forum postings share a number of properties with historical texts, for example, nonstandard orthography and grammar, and profuse use of abbreviations. The methods and techniques required for the effective processing of historical texts are thus also of interest for research in other domains. © 2012 by Morgan and Claypool.",Computational linguistics,Cultural heritage,Digital humanities,Digitization,Historical texts,Natural language processing,,,Piotrowski M.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In practice the Digital Humanities are methodologically defined by the principle of digital conceptualization of the objects and procedures of research. Who embarks upon Digital Humanities considers the objects of study implicitly as a complex of discrete measurable states, to apply, based upon this, computer based procedures: analytical, symbolizing or modeling. This mode of digital conceptualization of humanistic topics of research can in principle be used within all disciplines, as a digital lingua franca. Before this background we formulate two theses: (1) This methodological theoretical claim of universality has to be relativized by the Digital Humanities community through critical reflection of methodology; digital access does not turn out to be appropriate everywhere, when we make the specifically humanistic drive for knowledge the yardstick of a cost-benefit analysis. (2) The trans-disciplinary nature of the Digital Humanities may be politically ""unbearable"" by tendency from the perspective of traditional Humanities' disciplines, as it challenges their disciplinary identity. For the Digital Humanities community both of these theses lead to the obligation to engage in a critical self reflexion of their own methods - and open the dialogue with the established humanistic disciplines against its backdrop.",Digital Humanities,Digital philology,Modelling,Transdisciplinary methodology,,,,,Meister J.C.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That textual analysis is much discussed right now, should not hide the view of a broader disciplinary field.

This critique is based firstly on data about the composition of various government organs, institutions and the principal journals in the field, and secondly on a general reflection on the cultural, political and linguistic bias of digital standards, protocols and interfaces. These reflections suggest that DH is not only a discipline and an academic discourse dominated materially by an Anglo-American élite and intellectually by a mono-cultural view, but also that it lacks a theoretical model for reflecting critically on its own instruments. I conclude by proposing the elaboration of a different model of DH, based on the concept of knowledge as a commons and the cultivation of cultural margins, as opposed to its present obsession with large-scale digitization projects and ""archiving fever,"" mat leads to an increase in our dependency on the products of private industry and, of course, on their funding.",Cultural criticism,Geopolitics of DH,Knowledge as commons,Multilingual cyberspace,,,,,Fiormonte D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I identify modelling as the fundamental activity of the digital humanities and draw a parallel between it and our developing confrontation with the not-us. I then go on to argue that the demographics of infrastructure within the digital humanities, therefore in part its emphasis, is historically due to the socially inferior role assigned to those who in the early years found para-academic employment in service to the humanities.

The digital humanities are growing rapidly in response to a rise in Internet use. What humanists mostly work on, and which forms much of the contents of our growing repositories, are digital surrogates of originally analog artefacts. But is the data model upon which many of those surrogates are based - embedded markup - adequate for the task? Or does it in fact inhibit reusability and flexibility? To enhance interoperability of resources and tools, some changes to the standard markup model are needed. Markup could be removed from the text and stored in standoff form. The versions of which many cultural heritage texts are composed could also be represented externally, and computed automatically. These changes would not disrupt existing data representations, which could be imported without significant data loss. They would also enhance automation and ease the increasing burden on the modern digital humanist.",Cultural heritage texts,Standoff markup,Textual variation,,,,,,Schmidt D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The necessary generalizations and standardizations, management and development processes that large infrastructures need to apply to cater to wholesale humanities are at odds with well-known aspects of innovation. Moreover, such generalizations close off many possibilities for exploring new modeling and computing approaches. I argue that methodological innovation and advancing the modeling of humanities data and heuristics is better served by flexible small-scale research focused development practices.

After a brief identification of some limitations within digital history and internet studies vis-a-vis web historiography it is argued that the web is in itself an important historical source, and that special attention must be drawn to the web in web archives - termed reborn-digital material - since these sources will probably be the only web left for future historians.

To provide for an understanding of this conceptual mandate, we describe the development of digital curation.

My point in detailing the breadth of this collection, aside from a certain collector's vanity, is to ask what this diversity of reading material means for the reading experience. What qualities do I look for when I pick up a book, or any kind of ""readable"" object? What experience do I expect from the object in question, and similarly, can different objects produce different experiences? Answering these questions requires treatment of the relationship between literary aesthetics and textual materiality. This paper asserts that literature's aesthetic qualities are not produced by literary form or referential content alone, and asks how this assertion might impact our understanding of aesthetic experiences: how they are prompted, felt, and made interpretable by certain practices of reading. In pursuing this line of thought, I appropriate vocabularies developed in bibliography and platform studies to argue that literary aesthetics should be theorized as an emergent product of the interaction between elements of textual hardware and software. The paper thus analyzes shifts in aesthetics from internalist to externalist models, which invite discussion of the ways in which aesthetic experiences are mediated by aesthetic categories, here understood as the product of physical ""framing."" It argues for extending formalist readings to include textual materiality, and finally pursues the significance of this argument for disciplinary boundaries, articulating a ""return to aesthetics"" approach in literary analysis that pushes back on tendencies to use aesthetics as a boundary marker between the concerns of literary formalism and those of cultural studies, book history, and textual criticism. © Common Ground, Jennifer A.

Design/methodology/approach: As DH is a relatively new field and practice in Mexican academia, this article is based on a case study of developing the Biblioteca Digital de Pensamiento Novohispano (Digital Library of New Hispanic Thought). This is one of the few DH at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM), the largest public university in the country. Findings: It was found that there were three central problems for developing a DH project in a Mexican public university: existing technical knowledge and abilities at the UNAM will be challenged by DH projects; projects are the place to train human resources in DH methodology; and researchers need to consider different long-term infrastructure and hosting solutions, with or without using institutional infrastructure, at the same time researches need to work within the institution to establish a specific policy for research projects. Practical implications: The paper concludes that the structure, goals and products of DH projects need to be modified and expanded in order to also consider alternative goals and products such as: proposals of institutional policy, creation of infrastructure and academic and student training. DH projects must be regarded as disruptive, that is that the project needs to assume rupture as a part of the project itself. Originality/value: The experience of innovation and disruption is not necessarily the same in all fields and all institutions. This article documents for the first time the particular experiences of a public university in a developing country with DH projects. It has been found that the delay in using computers in the humanities in Mexico has led to the development of a specific paradox: a gap between institutional interest and disposition in the use of computers in humanities, and the lack of DH culture in those who have to develop the project. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Digital humanities,Digital libraries,Institutional support,Library projects,Mexico,Public university,Scholarly editing,,Saisó E.P.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fundamental rupture between digital and print humanities lies in the turning of a materialist, object-oriented analysis upon the practices of humanistic scholarship. That is, in their newness, the digital humanities are unsurprisingly self-reflective about the materiality of their scholarly practices. This self-reflection has been largely absent from traditional humanities where we had all but naturalized the material composition of dissertations, journal articles, monographs, and so on. As a result, even as we continue to pursue traditional scholarly methods, it becomes increasingly difficult to do so without a self-reflective awareness of the historical-material contingency of these practices. In short, they are no longer the same. To explore this issue, this chapter takes up assemblage theory, and actor-network theory to investigate the intersection of mobile technologies and social media in the digital humanities including conference backchannels and networked research communities mediated through Twitter, Google Buzz, and similar applications. The chapter considers how, even for those who continue to publish in traditional genres on traditional subjects, the development of these digital assemblages are transforming compositional practices.

It is suggested that those in the Digital Humanities have to be more aware of our history, impact, and identity, if the discipline is to continue to flourish in tighter economic climes, and that unless we maintain and establish a more professional attitude towards our scholarly outputs, we will remain 'present, not voting' within the academy.

Recently, an approach was proposed to describe and present structure and attributes of literary characters (i.e. the mental representation in a reader's mind), to explore, and to compare different representations using an ontology. In order to expand the ontology for literary characters, users must manually extract information about characters from literary texts and, again manually, add them to the ontology. In this contribution, I present an application that supports users when working with ontologies in literary studies. Therefore, semi-automatic suggestions for including information in an ontology are generated. The challenge of my approach is to encode aspects of literary characters in a text and to fit it automatically to the ontology of literary characters. The application has been tested by using an extract of the novel 'Melmoth the Wanderer' (1820), written by Charles Robert Maturin. For the main character, Melmoth, 72 instances were generated and assigned successfully to the ontology.

A tale of two cities: Implications of the similarities and differences in collaborative approaches within the digital libraries and digital humanities communities,25,10.1093/llc/fqr028,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-80051956333&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqr028&partnerID=40&md5=a82fe27b947171945c09b2c6bad7253b,"In addition to drawing upon content experts, librarians, archivists, developers, programmers, managers, and others, many emerging digital projects also pull in disciplinary expertise from areas that do not typically work in team environments. To be effective, these teams must find processes-some of which are counter to natural individually oriented work habits-which support the larger goals and group-oriented work of these digital projects. This article will explore the similarities and differences in approaches within and between members of the Digital Libraries (DL) and Digital Humanities (DH) communities by formally documenting the nature of collaboration in these teams. While there are many similarities in approaches between DL and DH project teams, some interesting differences exist and may influence the effectiveness of a digital project team with membership that draws from these two communities. Conclusions are focused on supporting strong team processes with recommendations for documentation, communication, training, and the development of team skills and perspectives. © The Author 2011.

This means not focusing on the new technical possibilities offered by the electronic format, which do not necessarily produce better science, but actually inventing a (new) political economy of social and human sciences.

It also seeks to consider knowledge production and transformation of a general humanistic attitude (the Humanities Program) in relation to digital tools. The paper also seeks to examine its perceived impact on disciplinary development, pedagogy, and forms of digital text. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents a literature-based conceptual analysis of distinct and diverse aspects of the enterprise of digital humanities, by identifying their main foci together with implications of these preoccupations within larger discourses. The analysis is grounded in a close reading of 45 exemplary texts published from the 1980s to date, and 14 exemplary projects and initiatives. The analysis highlights several concepts with their underlying assumptions. Findings: The perceived epistemological advantage of digital technology for new forms of reasoning is that community development has produced theoretical frameworks and shaped practical directions. The paper identified three distinct formations characterized by associated digital artifacts: prominent opinion leaders, foundational projects, and document forms (morphs). Research limitations/implications: Research data are not comprehensive. Selected texts and projects are exemplary. The results and findings are relevant for the English-language context and limited by a selective corpus. Originality/value: The paper outlines a historical trajectory of digital humanities and the formative stages of development from the discourses of that evolving field. It also identifies constructions of technological advantage with implications for knowledge production in the writing of humanities scholars.

Enabled backchannel: conference Twitter use by digital humanists,144,10.1108/00220411111109449,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952292203&doi=10.1108%2f00220411111109449&partnerID=40&md5=63335e5ffd7293ab3b3c3a465d083c7a,"Purpose – To date, few studies have been undertaken to make explicit how microblogging technologies are used by and can benefit scholars. This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitterenabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the coconstruction of knowledge? and How is microblogging used within academic conferences, and can one articulate the benefits it may bring to a discipline? Design/methodology/approach This paper considers the use of Twitter as a digital backchannel by the Digital Humanities (DH) community, taking as its focus postings to Twitter during three different international 2009 conferences. The resulting archive of 4,574 “Tweets” was analysed using various quantitative and qualitative methods, including a qualitative categorisation of Twitter posts by open coded analysis, a quantitative examination of user conventions, and text analysis tools. Prominent Tweeters were identified and a small qualitative survey was undertaken to ascertain individuals' attitudes towards a Twitterenabled backchannel. Findings – Conference hashtagged Twitter activity does not constitute a single distributed conversation, but rather multiple monologues with a few intermittent, discontinuous, loosely joined dialogues between users. The digital backchannel constitutes a multidirectional complex space in which the users make notes, share resources, hold discussions and ask questions as well as establishing a clear individual online presence. The use of Twitter as a conference platform enables the community to expand communication and participation in events amongst its members. The analysis revealed the closeknit nature of the DH researcher community, which may be somewhat intimidating for those new to the field or conference. Practical implications This study has indicated that, given that Twitter is becoming increasingly important for academic communities, new, dedicated methodologies for the analysis and understanding of Tweetbased corpora are necessary. Routinely used textual analysis tools cannot be applied to corpora of Tweets in a straightforward manner, due to the creative and fragmentary nature of language used within microblogging. In this paper, a method has been suggested to categorise Tweets using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of Tweetbased corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere. Originality/value – This paper is the first known exhaustive study that concentrates on how microblogging technologies such as Twitter are used by and can benefit scholars. This data set both provides a valuable insight into the prevalence of a variety of Twitter practices within the constraints of a conference setting, and highlights the need for methodologies to be developed to analyse social media streams such as Twitter feeds. It also provides a bibliography of other research into microblogging. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Conferences,Digital communication systems,Social networks,User studies,,,,,Ross C.,Terras M.,Warwick C.,Welsh A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this project is to synthesize historical reading practices, material evidence, and literature towards the creation of a prototype digital reading environment. This paper will document some of the conceptual and technical aspects of the project, as well as provide grounds for the discussion of book architecture and digital reading interfaces. The history of reading is rich with examples of the ways in which books were constructed, consumed, and shared. Particularly during the Renaissance, readerly devices came into increasing use as methods for overcoming 'information overload.' Today, these various trends in marginalia, annotation, and binding practices can be leveraged to develop rich, user-customizable digital reading environments. Attention to the history of the book, specifically the material interventions into the physical forms of the book by readers, binders, and publishers, can allow for new conceptual approaches, and subsequently, more varied and modular approaches to the design of reading interfaces. Various textual features, such as manicules, trefoils, and other graphic, marginal devices, as well as trends in binding, such as interleaving, offer evidence of interfaces that are far more robust than those used in popular digital reading environments. Incorporation of these features as modular, customizable components into digital environments can provide insight into reading practices and interface design, by looking simultaneously to the history and the future of the book. © Common Ground, Voytek Bialkowski, All Rights Reserved.",Book History,Codicology,Digital textuality,Interface design,Reading practices,,,,Bialkowski V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a growing recognition of the need, however, to test whether GIS can be used to map out the qualitative 'data' provided by the articulation of subjective spatial experiences. This paper expands the conceptual possibilities opened up by the use of GIS technology through an exploration of the theoretical potentiality of literary GIS. Drawing on work carried out as part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Mapping the Lakes', the paper focuses on the ways in which GIS can be used to explore the spatial relationships between two textual accounts of tours of the English Lake District: the proto-Picturesque journey undertaken by the poet, Thomas Gray, in the autumn of 1769; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-consciously post-Picturesque 'circumcursion' of August 1802. Alongside this text-specific focus, the paper also draws on recent spatial literary criticism to reflect, more generally, on the critical possibilities and problems associated with the digital mapping of space and place in literature. Ultimately, the paper seeks to open up methodological and critical space for the ongoing development of literary GIS. © 2010 The Authors.

Currently, even well-established large digital projects like the Linguistic Atlas Project (LAP) are at future risk because funding and other resources are contingent on grant funding or faculty status of the director, neither of which will necessarily be available to maintain the project over time. The mission of the university library, however, includes archiving and dissemination, now increasingly of digital materials as well as traditional paper. Collaboration with the university library is the only realistic option for long-term sustainability of digital humanities projects in the current environment. Unlike paper collections, which only require secure storage, digital projects also require the means of adaptation to new electronic media and operating environments. Even data storage requires that materials from digital projects be included in library media refresh cycles, which will include transfer of old data to new media as technology develops. Projects like LAP should provide resources to assist the library in starting the project archive, including staff time, and funding for equipment. Project metadata must be provided and, to the extent possible, integrated with library systems and finding aids. Project staff will also need to maintain a Web presence and tools developed for the project. Such cooperation leads toward the development of a digital institutional repository, in which research results and tools may be maintained in the library, not just for the humanities but across many disciplines. © The Author 2010.

This paper reviews a number of activities in the UK and Europe in the last 5 years which have sought to address these questions through processes of experimentation and targeted infrastructure development. In the UK, the AHeSSC (Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre) has played a coordinating role for seven projects funded by the Arts and Humanities e-Science Initiative. In Europe, DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) has sought to develop a deeper understanding of research information and communication in the arts and humanities, and to inform the development of e-infrastructures accordingly. Both sets of activity have indicated a common requirement: to construct a framework which consistently describes the methods and functions of scholarly activity which underlie digital arts and humanities research, and the relationships between them. Such a methodological commons' has been formulated in the field of the digital humanities. This paper describes the application of this approach to arts and humanities e-Science, with reference to the early work of DARIAH and AHeSSC.

Whilst originating in scientific domains, we have more recently seen a turn to the design of systems that support research practices in the social sciences and the arts and humanities. Attempts to embed large-scale infrastructures into research settings has brought to the fore the necessity of understanding the knowledge, skills and practices of researchers within a variety of disciplines that might use these technologies. In this paper, we consider an approach to gathering requirements through the introduction of various technical interventions for relatively short term periods so that we may come to an understanding their impact on routine work practices. Drawing upon an analysis of the detailed ways in which classicists work with digital images, we discuss the requirements for systems that support them as they collaborate in the interpretation of particular types of images. We discuss implications for the development of infrastructures to support research collaboration in this area and conclude with reflections upon the experiences gained from conducting naturalistic studies in parallel with design interventions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cyberinfrastructure,Digital humanities,E-research,E-science,Requirements engineering,Workplace studies,,,De La Flor G.,Jirotka M.,Luff P.,Pybus J.,Kirkham R.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technological development is consistent with human desire to draw on previous information and experiences in order to apply acquired knowledge to present life conditions and make improvements for the future. It is only logical that human agentive consciousness has always been directed towards encouraging action at a distance by all possible means. The evolution in media technologies bears witness to this fact. Many colleagues within the interdisciplinary field of the digital humanities are arguing that we need to invent new ways to interact with information, new ways to represent it, and new ways to make sense of it. Studies of Intermediality as Intercultural Mediation (SIIM) research seeks to explore ways to respond to these challenges under a theoretical hypothesis: cultural values about the idea of truth are shifting from the sphere of the 'real' to the territory of aesthetics. In other words, there is a move out from the private realms (states) of subjects (producers) and objects (consumers) into an inter-medial complex public sphere of intersubjective affective processes. Mapping such complex knowledge exchanges in topographical- discursive terms remains a challenge, but art and aesthetics may help. This paper explores the theoretical reasons behind the changes just described, advances a possible research itinerary for solving some of the issues involved The program of research into the dynamics of intercultural empathy will investigate the role of art and literature in communicative digital multimodal formats and the fostering and building of positive intersubjective and intercultural relations between social groups.",Art,Interculturalism,Intersubjectivity,Multimodal formats,,,,,López-Varela A.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an evolving notion and conveys the role of information technologies in humanities scholarship. Based on a qualitative case study approach, this paper interprets the concept by eliciting the diverse perspectives - which nevertheless express several discernible themes - of a group of humanities scholars. It synthesizes the wide range of opinions and assumptions about information and communication technologies (ICTs) held by these humanists by using Bijker's (1995) notion of a technological frame. The digital humanities domain is interpreted through three lenses: digital media as facilitator of scholarly communication; digital media as a platform for creative expression and artistic endeavors; and, digital media as context for critical studies of digital culture. The article concludes that, while technologies are being positioned as driving forces behind academic innovation, it is more important than ever to understand the cultural, social, and political implications of new media and how they are perceived and used by humanities scholars.",,,,,,,,,Rieger O.Y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This includes technical documentation of textual markup or database construction, and procedural documentation about resource construction. Design/methodology/approach - A case study is presented of an attempt to reuse electronic text to create a digital library for humanities users, as part of the UCIS project. The results of qualitative research by the LAIRAH study on provision of procedural documentation are discussed, as also is, user perception of the purpose, construction and usability of resources collected using semi-structured interviews and user workshops. Findings - In the absence of technical documentation, it was impossible to reuse text files with inconsistent markup (COCOA and XML) in a Digital Library. Also, although users require procedural documentation, about the status and completeness of sources, and selection methods, this is often difficult to locate. Practical implications - Creators of digital humanities resources should provide both technical and procedural documentation and make it easy to find, ideally from the project web site. To ensure that documentation is provided, research councils could make documentation a project deliverable. This will be even more vital once the AHDS is no longer funded to help ensure good practice in digital resource creation. Originality/value - Previous work has argued that documentation is important. However, the paper presents actual evidence of the problems caused by a lack of documentation and shows that this makes reuse of digital resources almost impossible. This is intended to persuade project creators who wish resources to be reused to provide documentation about its contents and technical specifications. © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Their study is a valuable part of developing critical thinking skills in students. Enhancing access to these ""hidden"" resources through digitization is a valuable service to scholars, students, and educators. However, merely scanning and providing full-text keyword search ability may not fully meet the needs of digital humanities scholars. Abbreviations, obsolete and regional word usage, idioms, misspellings and alternate spellings, and omissions in primary sources make keyword searching difficult. The addition of metadata in the form of normalized name headings and topics greatly enhances the research experience and saves the time of users. © 2008 by The Haworth Press.",Controlled vocabulary,Digitization,Full-text,Keyword search,Primary sources,,,,Bair S.,Carlson S.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, library science, literary studies, and computational and corpus linguistics strongly depend on online archives that are highly sustainable and that contain not only digitized texts but also audio and video data as well as additional information such as metadata and arbitrary annotations. Current Web technologies, especially those that are related to what is commonly referred to as the Web 2.0, provide a number of novel functions such as multiuser editing or the inclusion of third-party content and applications that are also highly attractive for research applications in the areas mentioned above. Hand in hand with this development goes a high degree of legal uncertainty. The special nature of the data entails that, in quite a few cases, there are multiple holders of personal rights (mostly copyright) to different layers of data that often have different origins. This article discusses the legal problems of multiple authorships in private, commercial, and research environments. We also introduce significant differences between European and U.S. law with regard to the handling of this kind of data for scientific purposes.",,,,,,,,,Lehmberg T.,Rehm G.,Witt A.,Zimmermann F.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Meaning and mining: The impact of implicit assumptions in data mining for the humanities,39,10.1093/llc/fqn019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-62549156318&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqn019&partnerID=40&md5=7d421074f3434f9b0d668afdfa089362,"As the use of data mining and machine learning methods in the humanities becomes more common, it will be increasingly important to examine implicit biases, assumptions, and limitations these methods bring with them. This article makes explicit some of the foundational assumptions of machine learning methods, and presents a series of experiments as a case study and object lesson in the potential pitfalls in the use of data mining methods for hypothesis testing in literary scholarship. The worst dangers may lie in the humanist's; ability to interpret nearly any result, projecting his or her own biases into the outcome of an experiment - perhaps all the more unwittingly due to the superficial objectivity of computational methods. We argue that in the digital humanities, the standards for the initial production of evidence should be even more rigorous than in the empirical sciences because of the subjective nature of the work that follows. Thus, we conclude with a discussion of recommended best practices for making results from data mining in the humanities domain as meaningful as possible. These include methods for keeping the the boundary between computational results and subsequent interpretation as clearly delineated as possible. © The Author 2008.

The role of the professional intermediary in expanding the humanities computing base,8,10.1093/llc/fqi036,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-24044555230&doi=10.1093%2fllc%2ffqi036&partnerID=40&md5=e18d730e12d167007aea1e28319b0cda,"Although there has been an increased uptake of technology-based outputs and methods in humanities research, substantial barriers remain to the full realization of potential benefits in this area. Some of these barriers resonate with the most basic challenges defined by the field of Human-Computer Interaction, including the move from computational to faciliatory computing, non-user-centred industrial design of research tools, the application of inappropriate experience models by users, and a cultural mismatch between researchers and technicians. This article develops a model of digital development in the humanities as a 'value chain', along which critical gaps appear when the only actors in the chain are the researcher and the technical support staff. Having identified these gaps, the article then goes on to suggest ways in which a dedicated Digital Humanities Intermediary (DHI) is able to provide much needed skills and support of a non-specifically technical nature at critical moments in the projects' development. This kind of intermediary can be instrumental in increasing technology use among humanities research staff, providing a wide range of technical knowledge and other support functions to the relevant faculties in a form that fits well with their own language and preferred ways of working. The success of the position is dependant on solid networks and the enlightened support of the University, however, as it is still very much at the stage of reacting and capitalizing on opportunities as they are encountered, rather than simply slotting in to a stable, static, proven structure. © The Author.

Many encoders cannot take their work to the next level by transforming their collections of structured XML texts into a web searchable and browsable database. Often teams of text encoders are able to encode their texts with a high degree of sophistication, but unless they have funds to hire a programmer, their collections far too often remain on local disk storage away from public access. <teiPublisher> aims to relieve some of this burden by providing the tools to manage an extensible, modular and configurable XML-based repository which will house, search, browse, and display documents encoded in TEI-Lite on the world wide web. <teiPublisher> provides an administrative interface that allows DL and DH administrators to upload and delete documents from a web accessible repository; analyze XML documents to determine elements for searching and browsing; refine ontology development; select inter and intra document links; partition the repository into collections; create backups; generate search, browse, and display pages; customize the interface; and associate XSL transformation scripts and CSS stylesheets to obtain different target outputs (HTML, PDF, etc.). © The Author.
