Your light switch is your vote': Mediating discourse and participation in the 'Vote Earth' campaign to foster awareness of anthropogenic climate change,3,10.1558/japl.v6i3.303,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952051150&doi=10.1558%2fjapl.v6i3.303&partnerID=40&md5=ff9a1d95703a0efd6597bea16980f90b,"This paper applies some of the major concepts and methods that Ron Scollon developed in order to analyse how discourses of environmental citizenship, sustainability and climate change are mediated in a global media event. 'Earth Hour' began in 2007 in Sydney, Australia, and in 2009 it was proclaimed a successful global event. The event focused primarily on citizen awareness, participation and solidarity in mitigating climate change. In its sister campaign ('Vote Earth'), the discourse of representative democracy was deployed to constitute an imaginary global electorate. The paper focuses on the analysis of: (a) the intense drive to visualize and spectacularize (mediational means) the simple act of switching off the lights and the consequences of such an act; (b) the massive infrastructure of discourse to synchronize the collective performance of a global 'climate public'; (c) the discursive 'memory work' to archive and memorialize the hour, e.g. on YouTube; (d) the attempt to inculcate a 'global citizen' who is concerned with the environment/climate and whose anticipatory mediated actions in relation to it are prefigured by the event; and (e) the resistance to the circulation of this new mediated discourse. © 2011, Equinox Publishing.",Climate change,Climate public,Global media event,Mediated discourse,Vote earth,YouTube,,,McIlvenny P.,,,,,,
"Rich internet publications: ""Show what you tell""",14,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79958115052&partnerID=40&md5=1717dab7f876536377a28de90e73c3b8,"The journal article is still the basis of scholarly communication. This genre, however, largely adheres to the rules of the printed publication and does not meet the requirements of this age of digital Web publishing. Today we do not need to restrict ourselves any longer to communicating the results of the research process only. We can also allow readers to inspect the underlying data online, to publish their own comments and, using a variety of multimedia content, to be witness to intermediary stages of the scientific discovery process. This development has stimulated the transformation of the conventional article: when published in a digital format, it is more and more enhanced with data sets, photos, videos, interactive maps and animations; these enhancements affect its structure and layout. A variety of new publication formats is appearing, some of which can be no longer adequately described as simply ""enhanced"" publications. They are rather to be conceived as a new genre, for which we propose the term Rich Internet Publication (RIP), analogue to the well-known concept of Rich Internet Application. Both share features of information integration, visualization and exploration (i.e. non-linear reading), typical for hypermedia products. This paper relates apparently quite different variants of scholarly publishing by highlighting common elements of data access and delineates the gradation of publication enhancement. RIPs do not constitute a sharply delimited category, but are part of a broad spectrum, which starts with regular enhanced publications closely resembling their printed counterparts, and ends with high-quality multimedia presentations having more in common with Web applications than with the conventional journal article. We distinguish two subcategories: RIP type I is primarily based on a linear text, but fully integrated with multimedia content and tools to access and analyze data, while RIP type II is more image-driven, has a user interface with more graphic elements and encourages explorative, non-linear reading. The production of enhanced publications and RIPs is not yet a straightforward process. It requires extra effort from the author, which is currently insufficiently rewarded. This may change when funding agencies get more interested in research products that go beyond the level of textual publications. Dedicated tools for construction of RIPs are equally important, which requires consensus on architecture and infrastructure. Development of these tools could fit in with the recently started research line of adding semantic metadata to object-based enhanced publications. Moreover, the creation of a RIP will rely on the author's basic competencies of e-scholarship.When authors start creating RIPs on a larger scale, the process of exchanging and preserving them has to be supported. Usually, a RIP is not a single static file, which can be downloaded and attached to an email, but a set of related components. Preserving the content's integrity will be a major concern.",,,,,,,,,Breure L.,Voorbij H.,Hoogerwerf M.,,,,

Design/methodology/ approach - The design of Searchling is based on theories of thesaurus-based interface design, combined with the principles of rich-prospect browsing. The Searchling interface provides the user with three working spaces on one screen: the Thesaurus space, Query space, and Document space. A total of 15 graduate and faculty researchers at the University of Alberta, were interviewed, who carried out three structured tasks in a thinkaloud protocol, with simultaneous audio recording and screen capture. Findings - The participants identified a number of significant advantages to the researchers provided by Searchling, including the value of having an interface that could help with identifying search terms, suggesting preferred terms, and giving bilingual search support. They also suggested areas for future improvement, primarily related to the assumption that common knowledge of thesauri would be sufficient to make the various features clear, if they were described using standard vocabulary from the thesaurus field. Practical implications - The interface can be implemented as an operational user interface to support users' exploratory and browsing behaviours. Originality/value - The paper describes a new visual way of incorporating a thesaurus into a user interface with the ability of browsing, querying and examining the results all at the same time. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Digital libraries,Information retrieval,,,,,,,Shiri A.,Ruecker S.,Bouchard M.,Stafford A.,Mehta P.,Anvik K.,Rossello X.

Beginning with a typological formulation of electronic scholarly editions, activities common to humanities scholars who engage with texts as expert readers are considered, noting that many methods of engagement both reflect the interrelated nature of long-standing professional reading strategies and are social in nature; extending this frame work, the next steps in the scholarly edition's development in its incorporation of social media functionality reflect the importance of traditional humanistic activities and workflows, and include collaboration, incorporating contributions by its readers and re-visioning the role of the editor away from that of ultimate authority and more toward that of facilitator of reader involvement. Intended to provide a 'toolkit' for academic consideration, this discussion of the emerging social edition points to new methods of textual engagement in digital literary studies and is accompanied by two integral, detailed appendices, published in Digital Humanities Quarterly under the title 'Pertinent discussions toward modeling the social edition: Annotated bibliographies' (http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/1/000111/000111.html): one addressing issues pertinent to online reading and interaction, and another on social networking tools. © The Author 2012.

This assumption has led to the idea of 'digital open scholarship,' which aims to open up scholarship to participants from outside academic scholarly communities. But scholarship, digitality and openness exist in tension with each other - we can see the individual features of each, but we cannot make sense of the whole picture. It resembles an 'impossible triangle'. Particularly confounding is the tension between digital scholarship and open knowledge, where the former is focused on the creation by specialist communities of knowledge of a stable and enduring kind, whilst the latter is characterised by encyclopaedic knowledge and participation that is unbounded by affiliation or location. However, we need not be permanently thwarted by the apparent impossibility of this triangle. It is a stimulus to look critically at the contexts of practice in which a relationship between scholarship, digitality and openness is sought. Constructive examples of such critique can be found in the emerging research field of literacy and knowledge practice in the digital university. © 2013 R.

New technologies are piled on older technologies, creating layers that call to mind an archaeological dig. Obsolete programming languages and closed mainframe designs offer barriers to integration with other agency systems. Worldwide, these unwieldy systems waste billions of dollars, keep citizens from receiving services, and even -- as seen in interoperability failures on 9/11 and during Hurricane Katrina -- cost lives. In this book, Alon Peled offers a groundbreaking approach for enabling information sharing among public sector agencies: Using selective incentives to “nudge” agencies to exchange information assets. Peled proposes the establishment of a Public Sector Information Exchange (PSIE), through which agencies would trade information. After describing public sector information sharing failures and the advantages of incentivized sharing, Peled examines the U.S. Open Data program, and the gap between its rhetoric and results. He offers examples of creative public sector information sharing in the United States, Australia, Brazil, the Netherlands, and Iceland. Peled argues that information is a contested commodity, and draws lessons from the trade histories of other contested commodities -- including cadavers for anatomical dissection in nineteenth-century Britain. He explains how agencies can exchange information as a contested commodity through a PSIE program tailored to an individual country’s needs, and he describes the legal, economic, and technical foundations of such a program. Touching on issues from data ownership to freedom of information, Peled offers pragmatic advice to politicians, bureaucrats, technologists, and citizens for revitalizing critical information flows. © 2014 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Invoking Aiken's Uncle Tom's Cabin and Dion Boucicault plays as examples of general patterns, the author first fill in gaps in the inventory of print paratexts, delineating a species of theatrical paratext different from the literary paratexts spotlighted by Genette, that, together with the publisher's commercial communications, referred away from the single author or drama and rendered the publication into a hybrid literary-practical commodity. Moving to the twenty-first century, the chapter touches briefly on the pre-digital academic publishing formats, print anthologies and facsimile microform, which involved paratextual and market practices variously inherited by digital successors. While acknowledging the diverse array of digitized playbooks, the chapter concentrates on the proprietary database Literature Online produced by the Chadwyck-Healey division of a conglomerate corporation ProQuest, couching the remediated play paratexts within shifts in global capitalism. These for-profit paratexts partly reveal their political economy basis in fusion with the ideologies of the academic market and the materiality of their medium, including a new species of partly visible protocols that the author calls actuating marks. Overall, the chapter uses old melodrama to open new views of the performances of paratexts across textual media and embedded in political economy. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,Wilson K.C.,,,,,,

We found that astrophysicists communicate with a variety of user types (e.g. colleagues, science communicators, other researchers, and educators) and that in the ego networks of the astrophysicists clear groups consisting of users with different professional roles can be distinguished. Interestingly, the analysis of noun phrases and hashtags showed that when the astrophysicists address the different groups of very different professional composition they use very similar terminology, but that they do not talk to each other (i.e. mentioning other user names in tweets). The results also showed that in those areas of the ego networks that tweeted more the sentiment of the tweets tended to be closer to neutral, connecting frequent tweeting with information sharing activities rather than conversations or expressing opinions. © 2014 Holmberg et al.",,,,,,,,,Holmberg K.,Bowman T.D.,Haustein S.,Peters I.,,,

As we hear these climate change reports and their predictions for the future of Earth, many of us feel a sickening sense of déjà vu, as though we have already seen the sad outcome to this story. Drawing from recent scholarship that analyzes climate change as a form of ""slow violence"" that humans are inflicting on the environment, Climate Trauma theorizes that such violence is accompanied by its own psychological condition, what its author terms ""Pretraumatic Stress Disorder."" Examining a variety of films that imagine a dystopian future, renowned media scholar E. Ann Kaplan considers how the increasing ubiquity of these works has exacerbated our sense of impending dread. But she also explores ways these films might help us productively engage with our anxieties, giving us a seemingly prophetic glimpse of the terrifying future selves we might still work to avoid becoming. Examining dystopian classics like Soylent Green alongside more recent examples like The Book of Eli, Climate Trauma also stretches the limits of the genre to include features such as Blindness, The Happening, Take Shelter, and a number of documentaries on climate change. These eclectic texts allow Kaplan to outline the typical blind-spots of the genre, which rarely depicts climate catastrophe from the vantage point of women or minorities. Lucidly synthesizing cutting-edge research in media studies, psychoanalytic theory, and environmental science, Climate Trauma provides us with the tools we need to extract something useful from our nightmares of a catastrophic future. © 2016 by E.

My motivation stems from an interest in the sociotechnical practices of archaeology, viewed as purposeful activities centred on material traces of past human presence. This is exemplified in contemporary practices of interpretation ""at the trowel's edge"", in epistemological reflexivity and in pluralization of archaeological knowledge. Adopting a practice-centred approach, I examine how the archaeological record is constructed and curated through archaeological activity ""from the field to the screen"" in a variety of archaeological situations. I call attention to Çatalhöyük as a salient case study illustrating the ubiquity of digital curation practices in experimental, well-resourced and purposefully theorized archaeological fieldwork, and I propose a conceptualization of digital curation as a pervasive, epistemic-pragmatic activity extending across the lifecycle of archaeological work. To address these challenges, I introduce a medium-term research agenda that speaks both to epistemic questions of theory in archaeology and information science, and to pragmatic concerns of digital curation, its methods, and application in archaeology. The agenda I propose calls for multidisciplinary, multi-team, multiyear research of a programmatic nature, aiming to re-examine archaeological ontology, to conduct focused research on pervasive archaeological research practices and methods, and to design and develop curation functionalities coupled with existing pervasive digital infrastructures used by archaeologists. It has a potential value in helping to establish an epistemologically coherent framework for the interdisciplinary field of archaeological curation, in aligning archaeological ontologies work with practice-based, agencyoriented and participatory theorizations of material culture, and in matching the specification and design of archaeological digital infrastructures with the increasingly globalized, ubiquitous and pervasive digital information environment and the multiple contexts of contemporary meaning-making in archaeology. © 2015 Costis Dallas licensee De Gruyter Open.",Archaeological curation,Digital continuum,Digital infrastructures,Ontologies,Social studies of practice,,,,Dallas C.,,,,,,

Hong Kong libraries have undertaken a range of activities to support digital humanities, and they embrace intra-institutional partnerships. Surveyed institutions also indicated that the potential for international collaborations, in particular, exists and is worth the efforts of further exploration. Their major challenges are building a strong faculty-librarian partnership, getting adequate financial and personnel resources, and enhancing staff experience and skills in this area. © 2015, IGI Global.

The need for these services has intensified since 2011, in the wake of U.S. federal open access mandates and funding agency data management plan requirements for grant applications. Through a comparison of selected features of tDAR and Open Context, this article highlights similarities and key differences in their designs, data management policies, and practices, and provides guidance to subject specialist librarians and others who advise archaeological researchers about how these differences can impact the suitability of each repository for specific data characteristics. © 2015, Published with license by Taylor & Francis.",archaeology data,data repository comparison,online data repositories,Open Context,the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR),,,,Sheehan B.,,,,,,

Crowdsourcing language change with smartphone applications,25,10.1371/journal.pone.0143060,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84953741551&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0143060&partnerID=40&md5=5a77bf5b95c1e41394dcd97415411f6d,"Crowdsourcing linguistic phenomena with smartphone applications is relatively new. In linguistics, apps have predominantly been developed to create pronunciation dictionaries, to train acoustic models, and to archive endangered languages. This paper presents the first account of how apps can be used to collect data suitable for documenting language change: we created an app, Dialäkt Äpp (DÄ), which predicts users' dialects. For 16 linguistic variables, users select a dialectal variant from a drop-down menu. DÄ then geographically locates the user's dialect by suggesting a list of communes where dialect variants most similar to their choices are used. Underlying this prediction are 16 maps from the historical Linguistic Atlas of German-speaking Switzerland, which documents the linguistic situation around 1950. Where users disagree with the prediction, they can indicate what they consider to be their dialect's location. With this information, the 16 variables can be assessed for language change. Thanks to the playfulness of its functionality, DÄ has reached many users; our linguistic analyses are based on data from nearly 60,000 speakers. Results reveal a relative stability for phonetic variables, while lexical and morphological variables seem more prone to change. Crowdsourcing large amounts of dialect data with smartphone apps has the potential to complement existing data collection techniques and to provide evidence that traditional methods cannot, with normal resources, hope to gather. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize a range of methodological caveats, including sparse knowledge of users' linguistic backgrounds (users only indicate age, sex) and users' self-declaration of their dialect. These are discussed and evaluated in detail here. Findings remain intriguing nevertheless: As a means of quality control, we report that traditional dialectological methods have revealed trends similar to those found by the app. This underlines the validity of the crowdsourcing method. We are presently extending DÄ architecture to other languages. © 2016 Leemann et al.

Communicating New Library Roles to Enable Digital Scholarship: A Review Article,30,10.1080/13614533.2016.1181665,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84969988607&doi=10.1080%2f13614533.2016.1181665&partnerID=40&md5=2927cf679286ba2ef5152d07de1c7dad,"Academic libraries enable a wide range of digital scholarship activities, increasingly as a partner rather than as a service provider. Communicating that shift in role is challenging, not least as digital scholarship is a new field with many players whose activities on campus can be disjointed. The library's actual and potential contributions need to be broadcast to a diverse range of internal and external constituencies, primarily academic staff, university management, library colleagues and related project teams, often with different perspectives. Libraries have significant contributions to offer and a focused communications strategy is needed to embed libraries in digital scholarship and to create new perceptions of their role as enabling partners. © 2016, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",communications strategy,Digital scholarship,digitization,open access publishing,roles,scholarly communication,university libraries,,Cox J.,,,,,,
The organizing of scientific fields: The case of corpus linguistics,6,10.1017/S1062798716000259,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84988613827&doi=10.1017%2fS1062798716000259&partnerID=40&md5=ddbe96a5b4f52e4b7d9d39e9ae459bcc,"This paper focuses on the processes through which scientific fields are organized over time. It is argued that new approaches in scientific work are hampered by authority structures within national systems for research and established approaches within disciplines, but that these obstacles can be overcome by means of external funding, particularly through new funding sources, as well as the international developments of an innovation. As far as the latter are concerned, they are expected to first lead to informal collaboration among scholars. In the passage of time this informal collaboration becomes more and more formalized. In order to analyse such processes the paper presents a model with three phases labelled as creating, gathering and communicating. This model is then used in an empirical study of corpus linguistics, i.e. the systematic analysis of well-defined populations of written and/or spoken language material. It is shown in the paper how corpus linguistics was developed by scientific innovators who were initially questioned. With the passage of time they created a number of international organizations, which have eventually become more and more formalized, many of them publishing their own journals. In this way the paper demonstrates the significance of organizing for the development of scientific fields. © Academia Europaea 2016.",,,,,,,,,Engwall L.,Hedmo T.,,,,,

We found a limited awareness among employees regarding climate policy. We found that horizontal information flow through informal social networks was an important way in which climate-change information was communicated. We also found a lack of confidence among employees in their ability to provide feedback to agency leadership. Our results suggest that (1) agency leadership’s ability to set priorities and deliver positive vision is important for increasing employee awareness and inspiring actions, (2) the agency could play a role in facilitating formal and informal networking among employees, and (3) using advanced information technologies may contribute to information flow horizontally and vertically, formally and informally. © 2016, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Climate information,forest management,intraorganizational communication,knowledge transfer,organizational learning,public land,,,Laatsch J.,Ma Z.,,,,,

The oaths survive in the overwhelmingly Latin land books from the period between 1386 and 1446 for six localities Greater Poland, in which the land courts operated: Poznań, Kościan, Pyzdry, Gniezno, Konin and Kalisz. A diplomatic edition of the oaths was published in five volumes by Polish historical linguists (Kowalewicz & Kuraszkiewicz 1959-1966). The edition is the only comprehensive resource of considerable scope (over 6300 oaths from the years 1386-1446) for the study of the earliest attestations of the Polish language beyond glosses. Recognising some limitations, but most of all its unparalleled coverage of the coexistence of Latin and the vernacular, the ROThA project embarks on transforming the edition into an open up-to-date digital resource.

But what if cities have long been built for intelligence, maybe for millennia? In Code and Clay, Data and Dirt Shannon Mattern advances the provocative argument that our urban spaces have been “smart” and mediated for thousands of years. Offering powerful new ways of thinking about our cities, Code and Clay, Data and Dirt goes far beyond the standard historical concepts of origins, development, revolutions, and the accomplishments of an elite few. Mattern shows that in their architecture, laws, street layouts, and civic knowledge-and through technologies including the telephone, telegraph, radio, printing, writing, and even the human voice-cities have long negotiated a rich exchange between analog and digital, code and clay, data and dirt, ether and ore. Mattern’s vivid prose takes readers through a historically and geographically broad range of stories, scenes, and locations, synthesizing a new narrative for our urban spaces. Taking media archaeology to the city’s streets, Code and Clay, Data and Dirt reveals new ways to write our urban, media, and cultural histories. © 2017 by the Regents of the University of Minnesota.

Whilst university websites are an important branding tool, academic institutions are also beginning to exploit social media. Image-based social media services such as Instagram are particularly popular at the moment. It is therefore logical for universities to have a presence on popular image-based social media services such as Instagram. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the online presence of UK universities on Instagram in an initial investigation of use. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes webometric data collection, and content analysis methodology. Findings - The results indicate that at the time of data analysis for this investigation (In the Spring of 2015), UK universities had a limited presence on Instagram for general university accounts, with only 51 out of 128 institutions having an account. The most common types of images posted were humanizing (31.0 percent), showcasing (28.8 percent), and orienting (14.3 percent). Orienting images were more likely to receive likes than other image types, and crowdsourcing images were more likely to receive comments. Originality/value - This paper gives a valuable insight into the image posting practices of UK universities on Instagram.

The former topic drives attention on academics’ new practices in digital, open and networked contexts; the second is focused on the requirements and strategies to promote academics’ professional learning and career advancement. The research question addressing this study is: are faculty development strategies hindered by the lack of a cohesive view in the research on digital scholarship? The main assumption guiding this research question is that clear conceptual frameworks and models of professional practice lead to effective faculty development strategies. Through a wide overview of the evolution of both digital scholarship and faculty development, followed by a conceptual analysis of the intersections between fields, the paper attempts to show the extent on which the situation in one area (digital scholarship) might encompass criticalities for the other (faculty development) in terms of research and practices. Furthermore, three scenarios based on the several perspectives of digital scholarship are built in order to explore the research question in depth. We conclude that at the current state of art the relationship between these two topics is weak.

However, so far most corpus-based research in this field has been hampered by the manual nature of the visual analyses (see, e.g., Tyrkkö, Marttila & Suhr 2013 and Tyrkkö 2013). The manual measuring and evaluation of visual features in a consistent manner is both slow and prone to human error, particularly with volumes of texts sufficient for statistical interrogation. As a result, while the linguistic analysis of historical texts can be rigorously systematic and corpus-based, the visual data, when taken into account at all, have typically been rather scarce and anecdotal in nature. In this paper, I will discuss new computational methods of analysing diachronic changes in visual features of title-pages and body text, and of combining that information with linguistic data. Using two linguistic corpora, Early Modern English Medical Texts and Late Modern English Medical Texts, and ImagePlot 1.1, a tool designed for the analysis of visual data, I will first map the paratextual features of the medical books and turn them into a matrix of statistically usable data points (Manovich 2012, 2013) for further processing. © 2017 Society for Studia Neophilologica.",corpus,diachronic,early modern,image analysis,Paratext,printing,stylometry,title-page,Tyrkkö J.,,,,,,

Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged in DH a bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g. [Deegan and McCarthy] [Griffin and Hayler 2016] [Hayler and Griffin 2016]), we analyse three types of DH collaboration: 1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3) machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement with collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through how DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest that understanding these entanglements facilitates a critical DH in which academic hierarchies and disciplinary preconceptions are challenged. © 2018, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations.

One such example is the geographic information embedded within user-generated content collected and curated by the social media giants. Such geographic data can be encoded either explicitly as geotags or implicitly as geographical references expressed as texts that comprise part of a title or image caption. To use such data for knowledge building there is a need for new mapping interfaces. These interfaces should support both data integration and visualization, and geographical exploration with openended discovery. Based on a user scenario on the Via Francigena (a significant European cultural route), we set out to adapt an existing humanities interface to support social and spatial exploration of how the route is perceived. Our dataset was derived from Instagram. We adopted a thinking by doing approach to co-design an interdisciplinary prototype and discuss the six stages of activity, beginning with the definition of the use case and ending in experimentation with a working technology prototype. Through reflection on the process of tool modification and an in-depth exploration of the data encoding, we were better able to understand the strengths and limitations of the data, the tool, and the underlying workflows. This in-depth knowledge helped us to define a set of requirements for tools and data that will serve as a valuable contribution for those engaged in the design of deep mapping interfaces for place-based research. © by the author(s).",Co-design,Co-occurrence graphs,Cultural routes,Deep maps,Geovisualization,Instagram,Interfaces,Social media,Jones C.E.,Guido D.,Severo M.,,,,

Aside from discussing the characteristics of digital archaeology, the social networking sites (SNS) Twitter, Sketchfab, and ResearchGate are integrated into a digital research data dissemination tool. As a result, above-average engagement rates with few impressions were observed. Compared with that, status updates focusing on actual fieldwork and other research activities gain high numbers of impressions with below-average engagement rates. It is believed that most of the interactions are restricted to a core audience and that a clearly defined social media strategy is obligatory for successful research data dissemination in archaeology, combined with regular posts in the SNS. Additionally, active followers are of highest importance. © 2018, Archaeological Centre Olomouc.

GS is a scholarly communications research laboratory dedicated to using collaborative models and design principles in the creation of scholarly works. Scholarship laboratories that function as a combination of a scientific research lab and an art studio are a useful means of advancing the methods and outcomes of scholarly communications. We intend to examine whether flattening hierarchies through the GS model is a significant challenge for librarians who work within transactional models of interaction and are closely tied to faculty-driven service models of research support. Other participants typically thought of as supporting faculty are embedded as equal participants in the design process. We will apply qualitative methods to examine whether the GS design process facilitates development of new models of interaction among faculty, librarians, design technologists and other experts. Preliminary experience finds most participants embrace the collaborative model and are energized by the experience. Our assessment will focus on GS techniques as drivers for role and scholarly output changes, how these experiences might translate into changes in library culture or services, and on practical findings related to space, technology usage and administrative hurdles.

Digital Criminology: Crime and Justice in Digital Society is the first interdisciplinary scholarly investigation extending beyond traditional topics of cybercrime, policing and the law to consider the implications of digital society for public engagement with crime and justice movements. This book seeks to connect the disparate fields of criminology, sociology, legal studies, politics, media and cultural studies in the study of crime and justice. Drawing together intersecting conceptual frameworks, Digital Criminology examines conceptual, legal, political and cultural framings of crime, formal justice responses and informal citizen-led justice movements in our increasingly connected global and digital society. Building on case study examples from across Australia, Canada, Europe, China, the UK and the United States, Digital Criminology explores key questions including: What are the implications of an increasingly digital society for crime and justice? What effects will emergent technologies have for how we respond to crime and participate in crime debates? What will be the foundational shifts in criminological research and frameworks for understanding crime and justice in this technologically mediated context? What does it mean to be a ‘just’ digital citizen? How will digital communications and social networks enable new forms of justice and justice movements? Ultimately, the book advances the case for an emerging digital criminology: extending the practical and conceptual analyses of ‘cyber’ or ‘e’ crime beyond a focus foremost on the novelty, pathology and illegality of technology-enabled crimes, to understandings of online crime as inherently social. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,,Powell A.,Stratton G.,Cameron R.,,,,

Several studies demonstrate that the use of new and combined media enhances how culture is experienced. The beneft is in terms of both number of people who can have access to knowledge and the quality of the diffusion of the knowledge itself. In this regard, CH uses augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality technologies for different purposes, including education, exhibition enhancement, exploration, reconstruction, and virtual museums. These technologies enable user-centred presentation and make cultural heritage digitally accessible, especially when physical access is constrained. A number of surveys of these emerging technologies have been conducted; however, they are either not domain specific or lack a holistic perspective in that they do not cover all the aspects of the technology. A review of these technologies from a cultural heritage perspective is therefore warranted. Accordingly, our article surveys the state-of-the-art in augmented-, virtual-, and mixed-reality systems as a whole and from a cultural heritage perspective. In addition, we identify specific application areas in digital cultural heritage and make suggestions as to which technology is most appropriate in each case.

Humans use a variety of different gestures to convey these emotions, including squeezes, pats, and strokes. This paper presents a device for creating a continuous lateral motion on the arm to mimic a subset of the gestures used in social touch. The device is composed of a linear array of voice coil actuators that is embedded in a fabric sleeve. The voice coils are controlled to sequentially press into the user's arm to create the sensation of linear travel up the arm. We evaluate the device in a human-subject study to confirm that a linear lateral motion can be created using only normal force, and to determine the optimal actuation parameters for creating a continuous and pleasant sensation. The results of the study indicated that the voice coils should be controlled with a long duration for each indentation and a short delay between the onset of indentation between adjacent actuators to maximize both continuity and pleasantness. © 2018 IEEE.",,,,,,,,,Culbertson H.,Nunez C.M.,Israr A.,Lau F.,Abnousi F.,Okamura A.M.,

Specifically, the role-playing game Dark Souls 3–related activity on Steam and Twitch.tv was collected for the first 20 days from the release (12 April– 1 May 2016). Targeted data concerned several variables among which: most viewed streamers, streaming types, debating topics and reviews’ highlights on Steam (etc.) through screenshots, user-generated content, and text gathering. Data were processed and then visualized with the network-oriented software Gephi for uncovering associations and patterns in the targeted online environments. The action game The Division worked as an exploratory case study and counter-example for stressing the proposal. Although with some limitations, the visualization strategy adopted (four networks for each platform) proved to be effective in framing and communicating the results in a straightforward way.

Communication practices of micromorphological researchers have not evolved significantly or, at least, at the same rate as archaeology as a whole, which has recently experienced an explosion of technological applications related to documentation. This paper aims to explore and illustrate a new methodological proposal for thin section digitalization and for the presentation of micromorphological data in scientific articles. We started from a premise: micromorphology should be a discipline based on images, since they provide the essential data of micromorphological observation and inference. The proposal combines existing tools and techniques, as well as those from other disciplines, to increase the standard quality of images used in scientific publications and produce dynamic and contextualized illustrations of research results in micromorphology. The final goal of the workflow is to provide keys and tools that allow researchers, as producers of information, to present their data in a more effective, contextualized and informative way as article enrichments or linked illustrations in their papers. To illustrate the procedure, we use two samples from different archaeological contexts: the Palaeolithic site of Roc de Marsal (France) and the Roman city of Baelo Claudia (Spain). The benefits of this proposal are multiple: a) access and objectivity to raw research data, b) improvement in the interaction among micromorphologists, c) spreading of the informative potential of micromorphology to the research community, and, finally, d) making the reader an active participant in the information. Although there are different eligible ways of image scanning and data sharing, the combination of gigapixel thin sections and article enrichments define a step forward in communicating research results and sharing raw data, an opportunity that should be fostered and not be missed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Archaeological soil micromorphology,Article enrichments,Digital humanities,Geoarchaeology,Open data,Thin section,,,Gutiérrez-Rodríguez M.,Toscano M.,Goldberg P.,,,,

In order to try to address this situation, the UK Scholarly Communication Licence (UK-SCL) was formulated to bypass the root causes of many of these challenges by implementing a licensing mechanism for multiple-mandate compliance in one single policy. This is the first empirical study to focus on the genesis of the UK-SCL and how its implementation has been conceived thus far. A qualitative research method was used, taking the form of 14 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from the initiative across the UK. The results indicate that those working within UK HEIs are concerned with the complexity of the current OA policy landscape and are frustrated with the inertia within the current system, which has resulted in higher costs, further publisher restrictions, and has not addressed the underlying tensions in academic culture. The UK-SCL is seen by its initiators as a way to achieve further transition towards OA and take back some element of control of the content produced at their institutions. The study concludes by modelling the ways in which the UK-SCL is intended to impact relationships between key stakeholders, and discussing possible implementation futures. © 2018 by the authors.",Copyright,Higher education institutions,Licensing,Open access,Scholarly Communication Licence,Scholarly Communications,UK-SCL,,Baldwin J.,Pinfield S.,,,,,

These larger evidentiary datasets, in turn, help us to address questions about the human past with increasing precision. To take full advantage of these opportunities, archaeologists must develop digital literacy skills and learn how to lead digital projects. Here, we describe seven digitally-based projects we have undertaken at the University of Pennsylvania in order to create new tools for archaeological data collection and sharing, as well as to test collaborative models for the digital humanities programming process. In these projects, archaeology students work directly with engineering students. Through this interface, the students from both areas gain valuable transdisciplinary experience while experimenting with new ways to accomplish programming goals and to collect archaeological data. The learning potential for these students was a key motivation for our initiative. Our projects have already led to several websites and digital applications that are available as open source downloads. We present our impressions of this collaborative process with the goal of encouraging other archaeologists to form similar digital humanities partnerships. © 2019 Peter J Cobb et al., published by De Gruyter.",archaeological training,digital humanities,digital project management,mobile data collection,pedagogy,,,,Cobb P.J.,Sigmier J.H.,Creamer P.M.,French E.R.,,,
Elaborating a framework for communicating assessment aims in higher education,3,10.1080/02602938.2018.1522615,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055679296&doi=10.1080%2f02602938.2018.1522615&partnerID=40&md5=d967414ff628b6bc3b5677c748379a13,"Assessment is a central feature of student learning in higher education and has a strong influence on the student experience. Accordingly, the appropriate communication of assessment aims is a priority for all higher education institutions. This study proposes an analytical framework for the interpretation and creation of assessments across higher education disciplines. The framework suggests that assessments can be categorised according to rhetorical purposes, formats, modes and group arrangements. Assessments from three degree programmes at one Australian university are analysed using the framework to show its usefulness in classifying and evaluating task components and generating broad images of degrees based on assessment regimes. We draw on these practical applications to explain and compare discipline-specific qualities of each degree, and argue that the framework might enhance the communication of assessment aims to benefit higher education stakeholders. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Assessment design,assessment framework,higher education,,,,,,Thomas D.,Moore R.,Rundle O.,Emery S.,Greaves R.,te Riele K.,Kowaluk A.

The findings of this study addressed student engagement in English conversation courses and the relationship it has with Poll Everywhere. Over the course of two semesters, students were exposed to instruction laced with an ARS in the form of Poll Everywhere to stimulate English conversation. The students were then asked to respond to how it affected their motivation and desire to speak English in class. Students overwhelmingly noted that the use of Poll Everywhere in the classroom enhanced their learning experience, allowed them to be more enthusiastic, interested, and motivated to respond in English, and generally increased their engagement in English instruction. Furthermore, it was noted by the students that factors such as anonymousness, novelty of teaching style, and the ability to aid in the expression of English allowed for them to engage more in English lessons as they produced English language in a classroom setting. The results of the study hypothesized that Korean university students respond positively to Poll Everywhere integration that allowed for enhanced engagement in English conversation classes. © 2004 AsiaTEFL.org.

There are consequently many common misconceptions about what AI is, what it is capable of, and how it works. Compounding the issue, opportunities to learn about AI are often limited to audiences who already have access to and knowledge about technology. Increasing access to AI in public spaces has the potential to broaden public AI literacy, and experiences involving co-creative (i.e. collaboratively creative) AI are particularly well-suited for engaging a broad range of participants. This paper explores how to design co-creative AI for public interaction spaces, drawing both on existing literature and our own experiences designing co-creative AI for public venues. It presents a set of design principles that can aid others in the development of co-creative AI for public spaces as well as guide future research agendas. © 2019 ACM.",Co-creative ai,Collaboration,Human-centered ai,Public displays,Reflection on design processes,,,,Long D.,Jacob M.,Magerko B.,,,,

Mapping (for) resilience across city scales: An opportunity to open-up conversations for more inclusive resilience policy?,16,10.1016/j.envsci.2019.05.014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065968246&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2019.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=423355a84cfcf31b2c71edd33e2a44b1,"There are growing calls, across a continuum from international agreements to social movements, for strengthening urban resilience alongside reductions in inequality and poverty. Although there is broad agreement on what the term resilience means in general, different perspectives exist on how the concept should be implemented locally and controversies around its transformative potential continue. While differing social and institutional factors are important, the ways in which knowledge practices produce these diverse perspectives have been overlooked. To address this gap, this paper focuses on the role of spatial knowledge and mapping practices for resilience and disaster risk reduction. Traditionally, much of the spatial data used for planning has been quantitative and at broad, city-level scales. However, although experiential understandings of resilience have been widely identified, there have been few attempts to integrate these perspectives, often relying on qualitative andexperiential knowledge, into city-level resilience planning. Bringing together insights from Science and Technology Studies and Human Geography, this paper explores the opportunities that different mapping techniques provide for resilience thinking and planning. Our starting point is that science and technology are not neutral for governance and can both open up or close down governance options. Using case studies from Nairobi and Cape Town, our findings show that mapping practices are heterogeneous and produce diverse understandings of resilience. Although traditional methods dominate city mapping in these case studies, we find innovation at both the city and finer spatial scales. Maps and mapping offer opportunities for resilience via connecting diverse actors, scales and forms of knowledge. We suggest that more work is needed on how to include non-traditional methods, from those that value local experience and the voice of the marginalized to more quantitative mapping methods. While fully integrating diverse approaches may not be possible, nor desirable, bringing them into conversation helps open-up deliberative spaces for resilience. © 2019 The Authors",Cape Town,Informal settlements,Mapping,Nairobi,Resilience,Science-policy,,,Borie M.,Ziervogel G.,Taylor F.E.,Millington J.D.A.,Sitas R.,Pelling M.,
Having your story and data too: The Australian colonial narrative journalism database,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083875561&partnerID=40&md5=24de8a6b0b3c27e8c1a20cac18f9a07a,"The Australian Colonial Narrative Journalism (ACNJ) database (1788-1901) is a digital archive of colonial literary journalism. It is an expression of cultural memory in Australia using examples of colonial writers and their featured works-from the journalists who captured the bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang, to those who sailed undercover to expose the “blackbirding” trade in northern Australia, to the women who first wrote and published Australian profiles, including the earliest known written portraits of Aboriginal Australians. Research institutions are increasingly interested in creative digital dissemination strategies to target audiences for exploring, interrogating, and communicating new knowledge both within and beyond academia. At the same time, the focus of archival theory, in acknowledgement of the political framework behind archiving, has moved from evidence to memory. The online archivist has been transformed from a passive curator to a community facilitator, asking questions around the role of archives-whether the archives are being posited as projects of collective identity that serve the interests of the community in power or as diverse collections from a range of communities with differing levels of empowerment. With those factors in mind, this study explores the creation of the database and its transfer from an experimental WordPress site to being hosted by AustLit, the online national literary research resource. In the process, the study examines the issues involved in establishing and building the database, which range from attempts to define the form as it evolved in Australia's colonial history, to the potential role of the database as a cultural narrator, a creator and facilitator of cultural memory, and a creative dissemination strategy rendering social historical themes in a democratized online form that can be delivered to a broad constituency of users. © 2019 Literary Journalism Studies.

This paper compares a traditional ‘pipeline’ with a networked ‘platform’ model of fieldwork, assessing the impact of technology-enabled participation on archaeology’s disciplinary and professional boundaries. In contrast to the collaborative potential of peer-to-peer systems, the current vogue for intra-site digital tools (such as tablet recording, GIS, and 3D technologies) can be seen to augment rather than reinvent pre-digital workflows. This point will be illustrated through an assessment of the UK based collaborative platform, DigVentures, in contrast with recent high-profile initiatives to transition to digital workflows by other established field projects. Evaluated through the lens of Nesta’s recent typology of platform organisations in the ‘collaborative economy’, it will model the underlying dynamics of peer-to-peer interaction by utilising the ‘Platform Design Toolkit’, considered alongside a worked project example and assessment of digital web analytics of the DigVentures platform. It will finally consider how a peer-to-peer system is experienced by scholars themselves, and the changing role of the archaeologist in a system that shifts the locus of work beyond the physical limits of an organisation, to open up the archaeological process to anyone who chooses to participate. © 2020 The Author(s).",Collaborative economy,Crowdfunding,Crowdsourcing,Digital,Peer-to-peer,Platform,,,Wilkins B.,,,,,,

These five approaches are (1) the cluster of science communication, science popularization, and knowledge dissemination; (2) the cluster of knowledge exchange, and participatory, transformative, and interventionist (action) research; (3) multimodal academic communication; (4) the cluster of visual anthropology and visual sociology; and (5) arts-based research. As each approach deals with (overcoming) the hegemony of the written academic text differently, the first part of the article details these approaches. In the second part, the Mirror Palace of Democracy installation experiment, which had the explicit objective of moving beyond the written academic text while still remaining in the realm of academic knowledge communication, is autoethnographically analyzed. The experiment allowed reflection on the integrated and iterative nature of academic communication, on the hybrid academic–artistic identity, and on the diversification of publics. Both the theoretical discussion on the five approaches and the Mirror Palace of Democracy installation are part of a call for more experimentation with, and theorization of, multimodal and/or arts-based academic communication.

In twenty-first-century archaeology, scholars can rely on vastly improved technologies to aid them in these efforts toward public engagement, including digital photography, geographic information systems, and three-dimensional models. These technologies, even when collected for analysis or documentation, can be valuable tools for educating and involving the public with archaeological methods and how these methods help archaeologists learn about the past.

In Study 1, we first assess participants’ extraversion trait by means of their own text data (i.e., by using a personality profiling algorithm), and in a second phase, target them with either a personality-congruent or incongruent political ad. In Study 2, we followed the same protocol, but instead targeted participants with emotionally-charged congruent ads, to establish whether PMT can be effective on an affect-based level.

The growing public mistrust in science has not been helped by efforts to produce visualizations devoid of bias. This paper further argues that ethical visualization can only be achieved by acknowledging and embracing the treacherous nature of data visualization as a medium, committing to an ethics of care in visualization, investigating the potential for both benefit and harm when visualizing specific data, and then employing strategies to mitigate the harm involved in creating, using, and sharing visualizations. These strategies center around consciously crafting a visual frame (ie bias) for communicating data to a given audience.

Due to the exploratory nature of this study, a case study approach was adopted as the overarching methodology. Wuhan University Library (one of the top university libraries in China) was adopted as the case study. Specifically, a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach was employed for the case analysis. A qualitative study was performed aiming to identify and qualify users' DSS requirements. The analysis of qualitative interview data pointed to 17 DSS requirements under five themes: formulating research ideas, locating research partners, writing research proposals, conducting research, and publishing results. Subsequently, a quantitative Kano model analysis was undertaken to validate, verify and prioritise the DSS requirements identified. Based on measuring individual requirements' priority, DSS requirements were classified into four types: must-be, one-dimensional, attractive, and indifference. Finally, a set of strategic suggestions for DSS development were devised. This paper is of interests to library and information science researchers, as well as library managers and professionals.

Specifically, how is economics made public on Google? Here we explore a methodological problem–studying google-knowing–and simultaneously explore the more pragmatic problem of the public-making of economics. We argue there has been very little attempt either to make economics public or to understand what is currently in the public sphere about economics. This is especially stark when compared to other knowledge contributors to society, like science. We start to remedy this gap by using a methodological figure: the google-knower. Google-knowing is central to how knowledge is created and circulated in society in the digital age and raises a range of questions at the heart of how we understand and make sense of our (economic) world.

The emergence of new forms of scientific publishing based on open science and open access have caused a major shift in scientific communication and a restructuring of the flow of information. Specialized indexing services and search engines are trying to get into information seekers’ minds to understand what users are actually looking for when typing all these keywords or drawing chemical structures. Using artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and semantic indexing, these “discovery agents” are trying to anticipate users’ information needs. In this highly competitive environment, authors should not sit and rely only on publishers, search engines, and indexing services to make their works visible. They need to communicate about their research and reach out to a larger audience. Driving Science Information Discovery in the Digital Age looks through the “eyes” of the main “players” in this “game” and examines the discovery of scientific information from three different, but intertwined, perspectives: Discovering, managing, and using information (Information seeker perspective) Publishing, disseminating, and making information discoverable (Publisher perspective) Creating, spreading, and promoting information (Author perspective). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Structured digital data are often venerated for their capacities to facilitate interoperability, equitable data exchange, democratic forms of engagement with, and widespread reuse of archaeological records, yet their constraints on our knowledge formation processes are arguably profound and deserving of detailed interrogation. In this article, we discuss what we call the emerging supremacy of structured digital data in archaeology and seek to question the consequences of their ubiquity. We ground our argument in a case study of a range of texts produced by practitioners working on the Çatalhöyük Research Project. We attempt to map short excerpts from these texts to structured data via the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model. This exercise allows making preliminary observations about the representational affordances and resistances of texts (which can be considered as a type of semi- or unstructured data) and structured data. Ultimately, we argue that the push to create more and more structured and structurable data needs to be tempered by a more inclusive digital practice in archaeology that protects difference, incommensurability, and interpretative nuance. © 2021 Piraye Hacıgüzeller et al., published by De Gruyter",archaeological knowledge production,archaeological metadata,archaeological texts,CIDOC CRM,Çatalhöyük,,,,Hacıgüzeller P.,Taylor J.S.,Perry S.,,,,
Advocating for linked archives: The benefits to users of linked archival data,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85121131941&partnerID=40&md5=4fd943fef239e78c90267790e0c92bc3,"Linked Data (LD) has been explored as a means of publishing and increasing access to archival data for over a decade. A growing number of case studies has demonstrated the ability to make both archival metadata and the contents of records available as LD, and recent large-scale projects suggest a burgeoning of investment in the tools and infrastructure necessary for Archival Linked Data (ALD). However, LD remains under-examined in archival scholarship; there is a heavy emphasis on technical aspects of the production of LD, but little consideration of how it benefits the users of archives. This paper details the benefits of ALD for those users, identifying four ways in which they benefit through increased and improved access to archival data, and through $/'¶V facilitation of novel means of interacting with, and interrogating, archival data. ALD enables archive services to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of digital native users and allows them to keep pace as technology evolves to satisfy future users. The identification and increased understanding of these user benefits can be used to advocate for investment in development of the tools and infrastructure required to ensure equitable access to ALD, and provide support for the call for increased collaboration in the preparation, publication, and provision of access to ALD. Collaboration with digital humanities scholars and practitioners provides many opportunities to further develop that infrastructure, increase the production of ALD datasets, and move closer towards realizing the full potential of LD for archives. © Copyright 2021 for this paper by its authors.

This paper shows how a multimodal discourse analysis can be used to as a bottom-up approach to identifying narrative themes that can be used in virtual experiences for cultural heritage sites. A case study on 11 UNESCO World Heritage Australian Convict Sites shows how diverse sources of user-generated content, tourism marketing materials and historical information can be analysed and then remixed into a virtual tour of the sites in the form of an interactive web documentary (iDoc). Although this case study involved a total of seven narrative development phases, this paper focuses on two phases, namely how the user model and content model were determined. These models were later used to develop the resulting iDoc prototype. The user model focused on the prospective audience of cultural heritage tourists, and a content model of narrative themes for the iDoc was developed through a multimodal discourse analysis. This bottom-up approach of analysing existing cultural data allows for the discovery of the prospective audiences’ interests as well as narrative themes that can be included in virtual heritage experiences. It also provides a new creative methodology that can prevent issues that may arise with top-down narratives that focus too heavily on one institutional perspective or national narrative and lack direct engagement with or understanding of today’s publics. © The Author(s) 2021.",Australian Convicts Sites,big data,cultural analysis,cultural heritage tourism,digital storytelling,transmedia2,UNESCO World Heritage Sites,virtual heritage,Basaraba N.,,,,,,

Technological advances and the diffusion of social media have enabled social polarization, rooted in post-Asian Financial Crisis neoliberal policies, to take on a new, more intense, emotional, and radical dimension in the virtual environment. The article examines a case study of an online conflict over the issue of misogyny in 2015–2016 to reflect on how a group of online feminists, namely Megalia and its splinter off-shoot Womad, have used the new media as a terrain for challenging the pervasive misogyny in Korean society. As the article focuses on the online activists’ strategy of mirroring, it highlights how the experiences and worldviews of members of both groups are rooted in identity politics and argues that the understanding of this online conflict should be embedded in similar global and national socioeconomic processes. Lastly, the case study also identifies some of the challenges that online feminism has encountered in Korea. © 2020 British Association for Korean Studies.

We understand the glitch as a sociomaterial encounter rather than merely a technical error, and argue that it calls for (re)consideration of here-and-now possible futures through practices of response and repair. Exploring the ways that people seek to respond to glitches, we consider two case studies in which unexpected problems provoke those involved to speculate playfully and practically about new possibilities. In the first case, a malfunctioning ‘Teacherbot’ incites new challenges and pedagogical opportunities in an online learning environment. In the second, Hungarian activists creatively use infrastructural and political problems to make new spaces of protest and to press the government to respond to their concerns. Considering these empirical cases allows us to observe how playful and disruptive dispositions have worked to question the terms of possible futures in the real world, and to unsettle the seemingly given terms of power-relations. Glitches are not a panacea, but they can provide an impetus to act from within situations that are uncertain, and can therefore point to new trajectories and possible futures. © Bristol University Press 2021.",Activism,Education,Futures,Glitch,Sociomateriality,Speculation,,,Bodden S.,Ross J.,,,,,

Two types of dyads-dyads with one depressed and one non-depressed participant (N = 15) and dyads with two non-depressed participants (N = 15)-engaged in a series of conversational joint decision-making tasks, during which we measured their skin conductance (SC) responses. We found that the participants' SC response rates were higher and more synchronized during proposal sequences than elsewhere in the conversation. Furthermore, SC response rates were higher when the participant was in the role of a proposal speaker (vs. a proposal recipient), and making a proposal was associated with higher SC response rates for participants with depression (vs. participants without depression). Moreover, the SC response rates in the proposal speaker were higher when the recipient accepted (vs. not accepted) the proposal. We interpret this finding with reference to accepting responses suggesting a commitment to future action, for which the proposal speaker may feel specifically responsible for. A better understanding of the physiological underpinnings of joint decision-making interaction may help improve democratic practices in contexts where certain individuals experience challenges in this regard. © 2021 Stevanovic et al.

However, these systems have come under increasing criticism in recent years for prioritizing technical disciplines over insights from the humanities and social science and failing to adequately incorporate the perspectives of at-risk or affected communities. This paper describes a unique month-long workshop that convened interdisciplinary experts to collaborate on projects related to flood data. In addition to findings about the practical accomplishment of interdisciplinary collaboration, we offer three interrelated contributions. First, we position interdisciplinarity as a critical practice and offer a detailed example of how we staged this process. We then discuss the benefits to interdisciplinarity of expanding the range of temporal logics normally deployed in design workshops. Finally, we reflect on approaches to evaluating the event's contributions toward sustained critique and reform of expert practice. © 2021 ACM.",crisis informatics,critical technical practice,interdisciplinarity,participatory design,workshops,,,,Soden R.,Lallemant D.,Hamel P.,Barns K.,,,

While examples of this work abound, comparatively little theory exists for grasping alternative designs, and for explicating their relation to other types of design and to design in general. In response this paper develops the key concepts of progressional design, frictional design, and design as prefiguration. The progressional conceptualization of design holds that designs have a primary purpose, and that purpose is to ultimately converge toward and ideally arrive at production. The frictional conceptualization of design radically relaxes teleological assumptions and productional expectations. Frictional designs prefigure possibilities that are compellingly resistant to further progression and final production. Prefiguration grounds both progression and friction in the idea that designs are partial, provisional, and potentially preliminary actualizations of possible futures. To illustrate frictional design, this paper outlines a framework of 5 frictional tendencies: diverging, opposing, accelerating, counterfactualizing, and analogizing. These tendencies represent ways in which frictional designs are directionally in tension with the arrowlike vector of progressional design. Several additional concepts are discussed in conclusion to further explicate more nuanced relational potentials between friction and progression: transproductional uses, teleological ambiguity, and relational multiplicity. © 2021 ACM.",Critical design,Design,Design fiction,Design theory,Speculative design,,,,Pierce J.,,,,,,

In today's digital world, people are more connected than ever before and have the ability to find healthcare information in a way that was not possible in recent years. Mass media and social media have become particularly influential in conveying health information to the public. With the amount of misinformation being spread, coupled with poor health literacy skills, it is imperative that new strategies and policies are undertaken to ensure that patients and the general public receive accurate information and are appropriately educated in order to provide them with the best possible knowledge and care. The Research Anthology on Improving Health Literacy Through Patient Communication and Mass Media provides an overview of the importance of health literacy and the various means to achieve health literacy for patients using several strategies and elements such as patient communication and mass media. The book covers health awareness challenges that have been faced recently and historically and pushes for better patient-provider communication. The book also examines the use of social media, virtual support groups, and technological tools that aid in the facilitation of health knowledge.

Given these qualities, games are approached as inspiration for caring technologies, especially for mental health. This transformative process often prioritises learning from games as systems, but not necessarily from the experiences of people with mental distress who play games for self-care. In this paper, we report on a participatory workshop series that sets out to further illuminate the connection between games, self-care and mental health from a humanistic, person-centred perspective. Over four workshops, we engaged 16 people with experiences of mental distress in speculative making activities and discussions of how self-care technology inspired by games could be re-envisioned. By thematically analysing our discussions and collective sense-making, we showcase how participants actively ""re-frame""games for self-care.

Based on the survey results, we have examined the interplay between factors related to digital transformation. The concepts of information literacy and digital literacy related to academic librarianship were used as the basis for the self-efficacy and empowerment necessary to achieve individual success during digital changes in the academic community. We then checked how such a sense of empowerment among academics explains the presence of information culture in this community and different approaches to information management. The factors of information management and information use were presented as affecting a university's institutional readiness for the new requirements of digital transformation from the perspective of governance issues. The findings highlight that information literacy underlies academics' empowerment and a high level of self-efficacy driven by this literacy can also be indirectly translated into the formation of pro-active information culture that strengthens an academic's position in creating information use outcomes and by making them ready for digital transformation. Through information literacy outcomes the academic libraries can turn out to be an important transformative force in terms of digital changes at universities. © 2021 The Author(s)",Academic community,Digital literacy,Digital transformation,Information culture,Information literacy,Information management,,,Deja M.,Rak D.,Bell B.,,,,

This monograph reviews the work that HCI has produced in this area, but also draws on related research in psychology, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, digital religion, psychopharmacology, and neuroscience. The literature indicates that transcendent experiences can be facilitated physically (through natural environments, architecture, art, music), chemically (with psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin, LSD, ketamine, and mescaline), and also digitally (in virtual reality, meditation apps, and research prototypes). Many terms recur in the literature on transcendence describing it as - ineffable, intense, ephemeral, paradoxical and sometimes sacred; mystical transcendent experiences are characterized by unity, epiphany, and an altered perception of time and space; common emotional responses include ecstasy, tranquility, gratitude, awe, and reverence. Such experiences are similar across religious and cultural backgrounds but interpretations vary according to world view. Studies record benefits of transcendent experiences, such as substance use recovery and improved mental health. We explore the themes in the literature through an illustrated design fiction depicting a near-future conference on transcendent experience (TX) research. This is an extended and illustrated speculation around brain-computer interfaces that might evoke transcendent experiences. The monograph ends with a manifesto calling for a radically interdisciplinary field that would bridge cultural divides and move beyond models of health and well-being to establish new forums and venues for TX research. © 2021 M.

Textual Migration Across the Baltic Sea: Creating a Database of Text Reuse Between Finland and Sweden,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139795937&partnerID=40&md5=638b655ea0f16e7483dcf95836faef95,"In this paper, we present a database and an interface on text reuse between newspapers and journals published in the Swedish language in Sweden and Finland during the 1645-1918 time frame. Using two national, digital newspaper collections, we detected their textual similarities with a computational method to study the textual migration, i.e., information flows, between the two countries. For purposes of this project, we developed a database of detected clusters of text reuse and an online interface to search, examine and analyse the transnational movement of information. The database, Text Reuse in the Swedish-language Press, 1645-1918, is accessible online and includes texts from over 1, 100 newspapers and journals published at approximately 150 locations at various times during the 274-year time frame. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Deep mediatization of everyday life, however, increases the role of the Internet as a critical system for crisis response and mitigating global catastrophic risks. This article offers a theoretical contribution to exploring the role of regulation in crises through critical engagement with the concept of mediatization. The article addresses the question of what is “the meaning of Internet regulation in crisis situations and how it may diminish capacity to address future emergencies?” It stresses that understanding the consequences of mediatization in the context of future crises requires an exploration of Internet regulation from the mediational perspective and of the concept of generativity. Relying on an analysis of the role of digital platforms in Russia during the Covid-19 pandemic, the article illustrates how different forms of regulation limit resilience by restricting the generative potential of innovations that offer new forms of response to emerging threats. It highlights how the limitation of political freedoms in specific countries and the degree of global catastrophic risk are interrelated. © 2022 The Author(s).

Participatory technologies such as crowdsourcing or wikis have been put forward as a means to make museum collections more open and searchable, motivated by a desire for efficiency but also as a way to engage the public in the development of a more diverse and polyphonic heritage. However, there is a lack of a nuanced vocabulary to describe participatory technologies in terms of democracy. Without a deeper understanding of how technology shapes the overall structures, there is a risk that the tools instead undermine democratic ambitions. Addressing the need to conceptualize democracy in these contexts, we therefore develop a framework for participatory technologies with an eye toward the long-term development and preservation of cultural heritage. In this framework different democratic processes intersect with democratic values, from a liberal conception of democracy to a more deliberative democracy, to an agonistic pluralism emphasizing the importance of acknowledging conflict and diversity. To firmly ground our vocabulary in museum collection practices, we have investigated two cases from museums in the US that have opposite participatory strategies for enriching images with metadata; the Smithsonian Transcription Center, and the National Gallery of Art collection on Wikimedia Commons. These cases demonstrate how the framework can be used to identify patterns of participation showing the support for different values and processes. Furthermore, our conceptual investigation points out a contradiction in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) research, between the pluralism and conflicts emphasized in more critical and participatory design perspectives used in the development of design, and the features in the actual design of participatory technologies, emphasizing consistency and access. © 2022, The Author(s).",Authorized heritage discourse,Crowdsourcing,Digital heritage,Metadata,Participatory museum,Participatory technologies,Value sensitive design,,Hansson K.,Dahlgren A.N.,,,,,

Despite the prevalence of lurking, it is still an understudied topic in marketing and consumer research due to methodological constraints. To remedy this, we introduce Digital Practices Tracing (DPT), a novel methodological framework integrating digital methods and post-phenomenological inquiry. This combination allows capturing naturally occuring digital lurking practices and uncovering their underlying motivations. The article’s contribution is threefold. First, it provides a detailed research protocol that can be easily applied and further scaled. Second, it applies the methodology to make invisible lurking practices on social media visible. Third, it introduces an ad hoc taxonomy of digital lurking practices useful to trace and measure them. © 2022 Westburn Publishers Ltd.",digital methods,Digital practices,lurking,postphenomenological inquiry,screencast videography,social media,tracking devices,,Audy Martínek P.,Caliandro A.,Denegri-Knott J.,,,,
Designing a Data Visualisation for Interdisciplinary Scientists. How to Transparently Convey Data Frictions?,,10.1007/s10606-022-09432-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85134664163&doi=10.1007%2fs10606-022-09432-9&partnerID=40&md5=f2afca0ed164268900d12e7ccbc64bb9,"This study investigates how the frictions that emerge while synthesising disparate datasets can be transparently conveyed in a single data visualisation. We encountered this need while being embedded in an academic consortium of four epistemologically-distant scientific teams, who wanted to develop new interdisciplinary hypotheses from their merged datasets. By inviting these scientists to collaboratively develop visualisation prototypes of their data within their own and then towards the other disciplines, we uncovered four data frictions that relate to discipline-specific interpretations of data, methodological approaches, ways of handling data uncertainties, as well as the large differences in dataset scale and granularity. We then recognised how the resulting visualisation prototypes contained several promising techniques that addressed these frictions transparently, such as retaining their overall visualisation context and using visual translators to mediate between differing scales. Driven by critical data discourse that calls for frictions to be foregrounded rather than be occluded, we generalised these techniques into a series of actionable design considerations. While originating from a single case of an interdisciplinary collaboration, we believe that our findings form a crucial step towards enabling a more transparent and accountable interdisciplinary data visualisation practice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Critical data visualisation,Data friction,Design activities,Interdisciplinary collaboration,Visualisation for collaboration,Visualisation transparency,,,Panagiotidou G.,Poblome J.,Aerts J.,Vande Moere A.,,,

We argue that citizen science can be seen as one element of “deliberative systems,” as described by Mansbridge et al. But in order to fulfil its democratic potential, citizen science needs to be attentive to various forms of exclusion and epistemic injustice, as analyzed by Fricker, Medina and others. Moreover, to tap the potentials of citizen science from the perspective of deliberative democracy, it needs to move towards a more empowered approach, in which citizens do not only deliver data points, but also, in invited or uninvited settings, participate in discussions about the goals and implications of research. Integrating citizen science into the deliberative systems approach embeds it in a broader framework of democratic theory and suggests the transmission of certain practical strategies (e.g., randomized sampling). It can also contribute to realism about both the potentials and the limits of citizen science. As part of a deliberative system, citizen science cannot, and need not, be the only place in which reforms are necessary for creating stronger ties between science and society and for aligning science with democratic values. © 2022, The Author(s).",Citizen empowerment,Citizen science,Deliberative systems,Environmental justice,Epistemic injustice,,,,Herzog L.,Lepenies R.,,,,,

On the one hand, it confirms previous findings that have documented the political power of data visualization specifically in the field of scorecard diplomacy. It critically discusses Portland Soft Power 30 Index that measures soft power of selected countries on the annual basis to reveal how the scorecard diplomacy works through the ranking dashboard. On the other hand, the article reflects on the experience of designing a geo-visualization system that, by contrast, intended to overcome shortcomings of data visualization’s politics to build a platform for an inductive academic research.

For that, planning processes should become more engaging and empower citizens to actively participate in designing their environments. However, the COVID-19 crisis exposed inequalities and posed challenges to communal activities due to restrictions on face-to-face activities. These constraints brought many researchers and practitioners to rethink the process of co-designing workshops, putting digitalization in the spotlight. The present study consists of a systematic literature review focusing on understanding how digital technologies affect participatory approaches in urban design and how they have evolved since the 1990s. Also, it investigates the correlation between levels of participation and interaction in different types of collaborative design workshops held in communities. We found that many authors have been developing new methodologies and digital tools aiming to digitalize the co-designing experience through mediation. However, there is no evolutionary evidence of tools in the field creating bridges between digitalization, participation, and interaction. We argue that a research agenda is required to produce more sophisticated tools to tackle social barriers and support inclusive design towards sustainable urban development patterns. © 2022 by the authors.

There is a prominent interest in the potential of technology for mediating social connection, with a wealth of systems designed to foster the feeling of connection between strangers, friends, and family. By surveying this design landscape we present a transitional definition of mediated genuine connection and nine design strategies embodied within 50 design artifacts: affective self-disclosure, reflection on unity, shared embodied experience, transcendent emotions, embodied metaphors, interpersonal distance, touch, provocations, and play. In addition to drawing on design practice-based knowledge we also identify underlying psychological theories that can inform these strategies. We discuss design considerations pertaining to sensory modalities, vulnerability-comfort trade-offs, consent, situatedness in context, supporting diverse relationships, reciprocity, attention directedness, pursuing generalized knowledge, and questions of ethics. We hope to inspire and enrich designers' understanding of the possibilities of technology to better support a mediated genuine feeling of connection. © 2022 ACM.",belonging,design considerations,design strategies,genuine connection,intimacy,review,social connection,,Stepanova E.R.,Desnoyers-Stewart J.,Höök K.,Riecke B.E.,,,

The need to investigate various aspects of digital transformation for cultural organizations has been heightened during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This paper explores how city cultural organizations can utilize digital stories for impression management to enhance public perceptions of a city. The aim of this study is to understand how end-users are affected by a city cultural digital storytelling information system and the benefits of using such a system. Design/methodology/approach: An interpretive case study was conducted on a digital storytelling initiative carried out by three cultural organizations in a medium-sized city in Canada. Data collection included 95 interviews with the general public, questionnaires and the gathering of documents. Findings: Findings suggest that digital storytelling can be a viable tool to share city cultural heritage information and positively affect end-user perceptions of a city. The overall outcome of creating/maintaining a positive favorable impression is shaped through a layered experience of benefits by users. Through digital stories, users are first personally engaged and informed about a city's cultural heritage, and then they are influenced and inspired positively toward the city. Further, factors, such as leisure learning, cultural heritage information and cultural organizations, situate this context of use. Originality/value: The study sheds light on how the art of storytelling in the digital age can serve as a powerful tool for conveying information effectively and influencing public perceptions. This paper provides a context-specific model to understand the use of digital storytelling by city cultural organizations for the purpose of impression management. Theoretical insights and practical recommendations are provided to explore the utilization of digital storytelling for raising interest and awareness in a city and managing public perceptions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Dissemination of information,End users,Informal learning,Information seeking behavior,Interpretivist research,Interviews,IS performance,,Nosrati F.,Detlor B.,,,,,

Thus, digital storytelling is becoming a significant part of social life and seems to be imposing a trend in humanitarian issues. This chapter attempts to examine the issue through a brief literature review on the connection of digital storytelling and cultural heritage. Examples of small-scale studies conducted within academic theses (mainly postgraduate) or funded projects are utilized in order to record the telling or retelling cultural stories, whether in everyday life or in more formal contexts, such as museum visits. Overall, the aim of the chapter is to reach an understanding of how short stories can redefine the way we perceive cultural elements, following the current societal trends for speed and increased interaction. © 2022, IGI Global.
